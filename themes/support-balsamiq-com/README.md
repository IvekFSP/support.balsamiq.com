# About
The repository behind https://support.balsamiq.com - a gohugo.io-powered, S3-hosted website for Balsamiq documentation and troubleshooting.

If you are viewing this repository with the intention of using the theme, please note that you will have to modify the includes, removing our specific assets referenced from balsamiq.com. We use Bootstrap 3, so you can just replace the section of includes under B.COM CSS and B.COM JS in the theme file layouts/partials/header.html. Instead use, for instance the HTML in https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/

For all of the source files, including SASS, content examples and gulp tasks, see the full repository at https://github.com/balsamiq/support.balsamiq.com. Some of the files used are also from the docs.balsamiq.com project - https://github.com/balsamiq/support.balsamiq.com.
