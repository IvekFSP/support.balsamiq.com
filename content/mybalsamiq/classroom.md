If you are teaching a course about human computer interaction, software design, user interfaces or prototyping, the [free myBalsamiq for classroom use offer](https:/balsamiq.com/free) can be a useful tool to add to your teaching arsenal.

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/resources/uxapprentice.png)

This guide helps instructors who plan on using myBalsamiq in their class. We also provide [UX Apprentice](http://uxapprentice.com/), a free resource for students new to user experience design. The site helps students learn the basics of UX Design with easy steps to follow, and pointers for learning more.

This document is always evolving, and we would love to hear about your experience in order to improve it. Please email your comments and stories to [peldi@balsamiq.com](mailto:peldi@balsamiq.com), much appreciated!

## Setting up the school's myBalsamiq site

The first thing to do is to set up a new myBalsamiq site for your school.

Head over to [www.mybalsamiq.com/signup](https://www.mybalsamiq.com/signup) and use your school's name as Site name and Site Subdomain.

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/myb/edusignup.png)

{{% alert warning %}}**IMPORTANT:** if your school's name is already taken, don't just create a new site. Instead email owner@_yourschoolname_.mybalsamiq.com and tell them you'd like to use myBalsamiq for your classroom as well, and to please add you as a staff member to the myBalsamiq site (you'll see what this means in a minute).{{% /alert %}}

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/myb/edutaken.png)

If you do end up creating a new myBalsamiq site for your school, you are now what we call the "site owner" for your school's myBalsamiq site. Confirm your email address and submit your application [here](https://balsamiq.com/company/contact/#/e). If you want someone else to become the site owner (maybe someone in IT?), you can invite them as a staff member (from the [staff page](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/sitesettings/#staff-members)) and then designate them as the site owner (from the [administration settings page](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/sitesettings/#administration)).

## Inviting your colleagues and TAs

In myBalsamiq there are two levels of registered users: staff and non-staff project members. The main difference between the two is that staff members can create new projects. A full access control matrix for myBalsamiq can be found [here](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/accesscontrolmatrix/).

We suggest that you invite your colleagues and teaching assistants as staff members on your myBalsamiq site, but not your students. Students should be invited to specific projects, as non-staff project members ([see below](#creating)).

To invite your colleagues and TAs, head over to the [staff page](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/sitesettings/#staff-members) and insert their email addresses in the form provided.

## Creating projects and inviting students

In myBalsamiq there is a concept of projects, each of which is accessible to invited project members and contains a set of mockups.

We suggest creating a project for each group of students and inviting students to the appropriate group. They'll only be able to access their own project.

Because we do not allow folders or sub-projects, we suggest using a naming scheme to help your school organize your myBalsamiq projects. For example, if your course is called HCI101, is being taught in the fall of 2012, and has 10 groups of students, we suggest using the following project names: "HCI101 Fall 2012 - Group 01", "HCI101 Fall 2012 - Group 02", "HCI101 Fall 2012 - Group 03", etc.

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/myb/eduprojects.png)

Once you have created all the projects, you can invite students to their assigned project via the "Manage Members..." link in the Project Menu on the home page or the project members pop-up dialog in the project itself.

## Making student projects private

If you'd like to set your myBalsamiq site up so that your students are not be able to view the work of other students, please do the following:

1.  Create a project for each student or group. Probably the best naming pattern would be to use the course name plus the student/group name.
2.  Invite each student to their project as Non-staff member. By doing this they can work inside that project.
3.  The default access level for the projects is set to "Private". This means the students can only see their own project. If you change the access level in the top right corner to a lower setting, then other students will also be able to see the mockups inside.

## Training your students in myBalsamiq and Mockups

Our tools are famous for being easy to use, but you might want to direct your students to our [support portal](/) for documentation and tutorials. I would start from theÂ [Creating Your First Mockup](/tutorials/firstmockup/) tutorial.

* * *

## Helping your students purchase Mockups for Desktop at a discounted price

Students who would like to buy Mockups for Desktop at a discounted price with their own credit card can do so by clicking on "My Info", then on "Desktop Licenses".

Note that the "Desktop Licenses" link will not be visible to students until after we make your site free for classroom use.

* * *

## Keeping up with your student's progress

You are a member of each project (since you created them all), so you'll get an email whenever a student decides to notify project members via email when doing something in myBalsamiq. This could be interesting (and part of that group's evaluation), but it could also become a source of a lot of email. We suggest creating an email filter in your email program if you'd like to archive or delete those notification emails. Or you could add a TA to each project and make them the project owner, then leave the project. ;)

* * *

## Finals time!

Whether you are a project member or not, students will be able to show you their work in a number of ways, but the two we recommend are:

*   send you a link to the [prototype view](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/project/#mockup-views) of their project, or
*   export the project to an [interactive PDF](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/project/#project-actions) and emailing that to you

* * *

## When the course is over

In order to keep your school's myBalsamiq site neat and tidy, we recommend archiving all of your class projects.

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/myb/project-archive.png)

You might also want to download a zip of each project for the students to keep.

That's it! I hope this guide will help you make the most of myBalsamiq and help your students get started on the way to becoming the software craftsmen of tomorrow!
