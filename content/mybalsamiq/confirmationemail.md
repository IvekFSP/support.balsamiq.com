## Site Confirmation

We require myBalsamiq site owners to confirm their email address because we want to make sure they can receive important automated email notifications from the app.

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/myb/confirm.png)

We send a confirmation email as soon as you sign up for a new site. If you haven't gotten a confirmation by email, please check the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) info below.

## User Confirmation

We send a confirmation email as soon as you invite new users to the site. Users MUST follow the instructions to confirm your account on the email invitation they receive in order to receive any notifications. Unconfirmed accounts will not get any email notifications. If you haven't gotten an invitation by email, please check the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) info below.

## Troubleshooting

If you haven't received the confirmation email after 5-10 minutes, please try the following:

1. Check your SPAM folder. We have taken every possible measure in our power to make sure myBalsamiq messages are not considered spam, but some corporate filters may still decide to mark our messages as spam.
2. If you think the email address you entered had a typo, please contact [support@balsamiq.com](mailto:support@balsamiq.com?subject=myBalsamiq email troubles) with the correction. We'll update it for you and re-send the confirmation email.
3. If you want to try an alternate email address or if all else fails, send an email to [support@balsamiq.com](mailto:support@balsamiq.com?subject=myBalsamiq email troubles) and weâ€™ll try to help!

If you do find our messages in your spam folder, please be kind and press the "IS NOT SPAM" button in your email reader.

If instead you work at a big company and your email doesn't get to you at all, please tell someone in your IT department to please _add *.mybalsamiq.com to the spam whitelist_ - they'll know what it means. ;) Thanks!
