## Savings When Using Both Versions

### 1\. We Already Purchased Some Mockups for Desktop Licenses. Can We Save Some Money on myBalsamiq?

Yes. As existing Mockups for Desktop customers, your myBalsamiq site owner or [secondary billing admin](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/sitesettings/#4-designating-a-secondary-billing-administrator) will be able to apply half of what you paid for Mockups for Desktop towards myBalsamiq credit, and you can continue to [keep using](/sales/maintenance/#when-does-my-maintenance-start-and-end) your Mockups for Desktop license!

Note: this credit does not apply to free desktop licenses received as part of a purchase of a plugin version of Mockups.

For example:

*   You purchased a 5-pack of Mockups for Desktop for $429.
*   You are interested in signing up for myBalsamiq at the Starter level (10 projects, $24/month).
*   You are eligible for a $429 / 2 = $214.50 credit towards your myBalsamiq subscription. At Starter level, that's more than 8 months of service for free.

See all the myBalsamiq pricing options [here](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#myb).

To apply for the credit you must be the site owner of a myBalsamiq site with a paid subscription:

1.  Sign up for a myBalsamiq site.
2.  Confirm your email address.
3.  Sign up for a subscription plan from the Site Settings / Payment Info screen. The first month's subscription will be charged to your card when you sign up.
4.  Go to the Site Settings / Desktop Licenses screen and scroll down to the "Existing Mockups for Desktop Customers" section.

5.  Click on "+ Add another" and enter your License Information exactly as shown in the Mockups for Desktop email receipt you received when you first purchased Mockups for Desktop.  
    ![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/myb/apply2.png)
    If you cannot find that email, you can retrieve your License Information from [here](http://scripts.balsamiq.com/lostkey.php).
6.  Click "Add License" and voila', your myBalsamiq credit will be applied towards future subscription payments.

### 2\. We Are myBalsamiq Customers and Want to Purchase Mockups for Desktop as Well. Can We Get a Discount?

Yes, you can. Mockups for Desktop is great for when you are offline or need support for more keyboard shortcuts or to take advantage of the higher performance provided by desktop applications.

myBalsamiq site owners and staff members can purchase Mockups for Desktop at $45/user, roughly a 50% discount off the [full price](https://balsamiq.com/buy) of a single user license.Â  (This pricing is not available for "project members"). You'll be able to continue to use your Mockups for Desktop Companion license even if you stop your myBalsamiq subscription.

To purchase Mockups for Desktop at a discounted rate:

1.  Sign up for a myBalsamiq site.
2.  Confirm your email address.
3.  Sign up for a subscription plan from the Site Settings / Payment Info screen.
4.  Go to the Site Settings / Desktop Licenses screen and click on the "Purchase Mockups for Desktop" button.
5.  Select the number of users and proceed to Checkout. After your purchase, you will receive a single license to share with all your assigned users.

## Using Both Versions Effectively

### Using the Same Version of Mockups for Desktop

The current versions of myBalsamiq and Mockups for Desktop use different file formats. You can export between the two, but if you are planning to work on the same projects in both versions you may want to use the [old version of Balsamiq Mockups for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/download/archives/?prefix=mockups-desktop/2.2.28/) (2.2.28) instead.

#### Going from myBalsamiq to Mockups 3 for Desktop

{{% alert warning %}}**Note:** Before performing these steps, please make sure to [update Mockups 3 for Desktop to the latest version](https://balsamiq.com/download).{{% /alert %}}

If you are using myBalsamiq and would like to move your wireframes over to Mockups 3 for Desktop, here is the way to download it from your myBalsamiq [project page](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/project/):

![](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/myb/project-download-BMPR.png)

The option is also available from your myBalsamiq [home page](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/home/):

![](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/myb/project-download-BMPR-home.png)

The "**Download BMPR**" option will create a BMPR file from your myBalsamiq project and downloads it to your computer. This file contains all the mockups and assets from this project in one file. It also includes the mockup notes, project description and alternates versions.

The resulting BMPR file can be opened directly in Mockups 3 for Desktop (from version 3.5.7 and above).

Here's how to export from Mockups 3 and import to myBalsamiq:

1.  In Mockups 3 for Desktop, select the menu "**Project > Export to BMMLs Zip...**"

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** Balsamiq Mockups 3 doesn't export [non-image assets](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/images/#adding-non-image-assets) so if you use them you'll have to manually upload them to myBalsamiq.{{% /alert %}}

## Roadmap to a Smoother Future

Our goal is to make Mockups for Desktop sync seamlessly with myBalsamiq, so you will be able to work either on the myBalsamiq editor in the browser or in the Mockups for Desktop browser on your Desktop, and your data will automatically be synchronized everywhere.
