## Secure Servers

All sites on myBalsamiq use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol with 256 bit encryption. SSL ensures the security of data sent and received via the Internet using encryption. It's the same technology used by your online bank.

## Access Control

Your projects on myBalsamiq are additionally secured by access levels that you apply. Private projects require individual user accounts with a login and password selected by the user. Users must be invited by the site owner or other staff the site owner adds to the site. Please refer to the [article on Access Control](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/accesscontrolmatrix/) for more information about configuring access.

## Sharing Content

myBalsamiq relies on self-managed Access control. The site owner has the greatest level of access followed by staff members. People outside of your staff can be added to individual projects for participation.

Individual Mockups can additionally be shared to allow viewing of images and prototypes using a URL with a key, which can be found in the Image Permalink function beneath individual Mockups, or by sharing a Prototype URL. This provides a URL which isn't guessable, and bypasses the login system. This only gives access to those individual PNG images, not to any of the normal project HTML views. It's useful for activities including client review and for usability testing.

Do not share these URLs if you want to keep the PNG images private. We recommend communicating with your team about how share URLs for Mockup and Prototype permalinks work so they understand that once they're shared, those images can be viewed without a login.

Please refer to the [Sharing your work with outside clients in myBalsamiq](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/sharing/) article for more info.
