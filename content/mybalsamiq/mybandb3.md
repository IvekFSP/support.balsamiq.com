## Going from myBalsamiq to Mockups 3

If you are using myBalsamiq and would like to move your wireframes over to one of our Mockups 3 product, here is the way to download it from your myBalsamiq [project page](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/project/):

![](//media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/myb/project-download-BMPR.png)

The option is also available from your myBalsamiq [home page](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/home/):

The "**Download BMPR**" option will create a BMPR file from your myBalsamiq project and downloads it to your computer. This file contains all the mockups and assets from this project in one file. It also includes the mockup notes, project description and alternates versions. The resulting BMPR file can be used in all our Mockups 3 products (from version 3.5.7) and above.
