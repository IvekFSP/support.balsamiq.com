A few people have asked us what the best way to group sets of Mockups together in myBalsamiq is.

This document offers a couple of suggestions.

## Using a naming scheme within a project

A simple way to group mockups that are related to the same feature or section of a website is to prepend each mockup with the name of the feature.

For example, in the project below we named all the wireframes about our settings page starting with "Settings - "

This approach has the advantage of keeping everything in a single project, which is cheaper and easy to manage (once you invite your project members you're all set).

The downside of this approach is that the project might fill up with lots and lots of Mockups, making it harder to navigate.

## Using multiple projects

Another, complementary idea is to use multiple projects, one per feature or section of a website.

For example, in our own myBalsamiq site, we have projects that have to do with Mockups editor (in red) and other projects related to myBalsamiq (in green).

Using a consistent book design and naming scheme makes projects easy to find.

This approach has the advantage of keeping the number of mockups inside each project smaller and thus more manageable, but has the downside of being potentially more expensive in the long run and a little harder to manage in terms of project members, as you will have to invite the appropriate project members to each feature-project.

## Will myBalsamiq make this easier in the future?

Certainly! With your feedback and help, we always work towards making things smoother and easier, that's our job! :)

We could add folders inside projects, or tags, or some sort of tree-view of Mockups within a project...[help us figure it out](http://community.balsamiq.com)!
