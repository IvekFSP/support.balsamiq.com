Here's a quick 5-minute video walkthrough of some of the highlights of version 3.

*   [Better Symbols](#better-symbols)

*   [Full screen mode](#new-full-screen-mode)
*   [Notes](#notes)
*   [Trash](#trash)

### A New User Interface

Gone is the annoying flying property inspector! Now you have mockups on the left and properties on the right. Simple, predictable and quick. The UI Library is at the top where it's always been but now it's a bit more compact.

You can toggle the properties panels and UI Library independently by clicking the icons next to the Quick Add box or via [keyboard shortcuts](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/shortcuts/).

And, of course, you can hide all panels using the icons for each panel, getting you into Zen-like wireframing nirvana.

Getting around and performing common actions is easy with the icons in the toolbar.

1.  Navigate between Mockups, Assets, Symbols and Trash
2.  Show/Hide the left panel
3.  View your mockups as a thumbnail grid
4.  Create a new mockup
5.  Mockup actions (rename, etc.) and navigate between mockups (_shown when left panel is hidden_)
6.  Go to next or previous mockup (_shown when left panel is hidden_)

### Easier Look and Feel Customization 

Control over the font used in Mockups has been one of the most-requested features since the very beginning. Custom fonts were previously available using a complicated configuration file, but we now allow you to set a project font in the new [Project Info panel](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/projectinfo/). Yes, you can now easily use _any font you have installed_ in your mockups. Rejoice! You can also set a default size for it.

We also moved the skin switching options into the new Project Info panel to make them more obvious (many people never knew about our [wireframe skin](/desktop/wireframeskin/)). Finally, the default selection color is also configurable from this new panel.

### Better Symbols 

In the previous version we called Symbols an "advanced feature." Well, no longer. Symbols are now for everyone. Symbols allow you to create templates, masters, and other reusable components to save time and ensure consistency. They are especially useful for big projects and custom controls and are central to our [Mockups To Go](https://mockupstogo.mybalsamiq.com) site.

You can now just jump over to the Symbols panel and create a new one from scratch and it will appear in the "Symbols" tab in the UI Library. You can still create them the old-fashioned way (creating a named group and clicking the "Convert To Symbol" button).

We also now show Symbols as a list inside their Symbol Library, so you can more easily navigate between them and know which Symbol you're editing.

Finally, we make it much easier to import Symbols. Just click the "Import Symbol Library" icon and select the file to import.

### Better Icons

Big changes here.

First of all, icons now have their own category in the UI Library so you can drag and drop them just like any other control.

Not only that, they show up in the Quick Add results, saving you time when searching by name or keyword.

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/icon-quickadd.png)

Icon search results are shown _below_ any UI controls that match the text you enter.

And you'll quickly notice that we have a completely different set of icons than the previous version. We switched our icons over to the incredibly popular [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) icon set. This means that there are now over _500_ icons pre-installed.

### Better Images and Assets

There is now a dedicated area for images and other imported assets, accessible from the navigator menu.

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/assets1.png)

You can add images to your project without placing them in your mockups first. Click the "Import Asset..." icon to add a file from your computer or the "Download Asset..." icon to add an image from Flickr or the web. Or just drag an image on to the canvas from your computer.

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/assets2.png)

You can also delete, rename, clone and download images from the context menu in the panel.

### New Full Screen Mode

The same options are still there but we've overhauled the experience to make it better for usability testing and presentations. We also got rid of the problem where mockups would "jump around" in full screen mode.

### Notes

When no controls are selected you'll see a place to add notes in the Properties panel. You can add notes for your Project, Mockups, Assets, Symbol Libraries and individual Symbols and they will be saved as part of the project.

### Trash

Balsamiq Mockups 3 now has a Trash for mockups, assets and Symbols you have deleted. This makes it easy to keep your project tidy as you make progress but still allows you to browse or recover earlier concepts.

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/m4d/b3/trash.png)

To recover a trashed object from the Trash panel click the context menu arrow and select "Restore." You also have the option to delete permanently.

### What's _not_ New

For the most part we left experience of adding, arranging and editing controls the same, so it should be familiar if you are coming from the previous version.

We hope all these changes are welcome and that Balsamiq Mockups 3 still feels like the application you've come to know and love, but better! If you have any thoughts or feedback, [please let us know!](https://balsamiq.com/company/#contact)
