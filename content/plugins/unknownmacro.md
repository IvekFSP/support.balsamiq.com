Are you seeing the following error message after enabling the new Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud plugin?

## Why Am I Seeing This?

You may see this error message if you were using the previous version of Mockups for Confluence plugin, and still have it enabled. The error indicates a conflict between the two instances of the plugin (old vs new), as they cannot work side by side. We recommend to [disable the old plugin before installing the new one](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/transition-guide/#installing-balsamiq-mockups-3-for-confluence-cloud).

## How to Fix This?

No worries, this should be a quick fix:

- First, please disable **both** versions of the plugin

- Then enable only the new plugin (Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud)

Now, when opening the previous Confluence page, you should now see the mockup displayed correctly.
