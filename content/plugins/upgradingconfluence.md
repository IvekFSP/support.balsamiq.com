Due to changes Atassian made to macro handling, updating versions of Confluence prior to 3.5.7 is not a cut-and-dry process (as much as we wish it were!)

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** In order to update to the latest version of Mockups for Confluence, you'll need to make sure your license has an [active maintenance period](https://support.balsamiq.com/sales/maintenance/).{{% /alert %}}

Here are the steps for updating your Confluence server to ensure that Mockups for Confluence upgrades smoothly:

1. Upgrade your Confluence server to 3.5.7 (if you have already updated past this, you'll have to downgrade to 3.5.7 temporarily.)
2. Install Mockups for Confluence version 2.2.10 which you can [download here](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.confluence.plugins.mockups/versions).
3. Once Mockups 2.2.10 is installed, you can safely update your Confluence server to the latest version.
4. After your Confluence server has been updated, you can also update Mockups for Confluence to the latest version.

Following these steps should allow you to gracefully update your Confluence server, and ensure that Mockups continues to function properly.
