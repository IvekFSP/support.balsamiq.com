Due to changes Atassian made to macro handling, upgrading versions of Confluence prior to 3.5.7 is not a cut-and-dry process (as much as we wish it were!)

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** In order to update to the latest version of Mockups for Confluence, you'll need to make sure your license has an [active maintenance period](https://support.balsamiq.com/sales/maintenance/).{{% /alert %}}

Here are the steps for upgrading your Confluence server to ensure that Mockups for Confluence upgrades smoothly:

1. Upgrade your Confluence server to 3.5.7 (if you have already upgraded past this, you'll have to downgrade to 3.5.7 temporarily.)
2. Install Mockups for Confluence version 2.2.10 which you can [download here](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.confluence.plugins.mockups/versions).
3. Once Mockups 2.2.10 is installed, you can safely upgrade your Confluence server to the latest version.
