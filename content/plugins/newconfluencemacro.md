## Updating Your Existing Projects to the New Mockups Macro

After you have [updated](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/UPM/Updating+add-ons) to the [latest version of Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.confluence/cloud/overview), your new projects will automatically update to the new, faster Mockups Macro.

Existing projects will need to be updated manually, but it's a super quick process. To identify a project using the old macro, look in the upper left corner of the mockup viewer. If you see the mockup browser or the menubar toggle, that's the older macro.

Here are the steps for turning the old macro into the new one:

* In the Confluence page editor, edit the macro, and launch the Balsamiq Editor.

* Once in the Mockups Editor, export all mockups to PNG, and then close the editor. The macro will be updated once you save it _and_ the Confluence page.

Once the macro is updated, the Confluence page should load much quicker, and will be completely compatible with Confluence's Export to PDF functionality.
