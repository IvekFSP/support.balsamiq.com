You may find that you want to display more than one mockup or project on a single Confluence Cloud page. This page will help you do both.

## Displaying Multiple Mockups from a Single Project

To display more than one mockup from a project on a single Confluence Cloud page, add a second Balsamiq Mockups Macro to the page.

When the macro editor loads, it will automatically select the project attached to the Confluence page. From there, you can select which mockup to show from the **Starting Mockup** dropdown menu.

Once you have selected the **Starting Mockup**, you select the size and position, and then click the **Insert** button. This will add a second macro at the cursor position. Save the page to see both mockups.

## Displaying Mockups from Multiple Projects on a Single page

If you have multiple projects that you want to display on a single Confluence Page, you can do that by first uploading the additional projects directly to the Confluence page attachments.

After you have attached the new project, add a new Balsamiq Mockups Macro to the page.

Once the macro editor loads, you will be able to select the project you want to use from the **Selected Project** dropdown. You can also select which mockup to display with the **Starting Mockup** dropdown. Make any size and alignment changes, and then click **Insert**.

Save your page and you should see Mockups from both of your projects on the same page. Simply repeat these steps for any additional projects.
