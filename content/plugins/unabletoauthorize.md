## Why Am I Getting This Error?

So sorry for the snag, friends!

First, be assured that **nothing on your side is causing this**.

Google made some recent changes and this error started to appear for some users. In fact, it affects multiple Google Drive plugin files (not only in Mockups 3 for Google Drive).

We filed a [ticket with Google](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/drive/oI8jJOKYmtg;context-place=topicsearchin/drive/category$3Areport-a-problem%7Csort:relevance%7Cspell:false) and we hope that they will be able to fix the issue quickly. They're already working on it.

## What Do I Do in the Meantime?

We totally understand that you probably need to continue working on Mockups while this is being fixed.

The easiest way to do this is to use Mockups 3 for Desktop in the meantime. It uses the same file format so you will only need to download the file on your machine and open it there.

You can download the app [here](https://balsamiq.com/download) and it comes with a 30 days trial. In case you've used this trial in the past, please [contact us](https://balsamiq.com/company/contact/#/t/b3gd?_k=gliitx) and we'll create a new one for you.

Please let us know if you need anything else, we want to do everything we can to minimize the impact of this issue.
