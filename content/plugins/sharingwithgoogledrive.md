This document shows a series of screenshots that illustrate the experience of sharing a mockup via Mockups for Google Drive, both from the perspective of the sharer and a collaborator who doesn't have Mockups for Google Drive installed.

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** If you both have Mockups for Google Drive installed you just need to follow the steps in the first section of this article or see [these instructions in the Mockups for Google Drive User Guide](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1559682#sharing).{{% /alert %}}

## Sharing 

Let's say you created a project called My Awesome Website.bmpr and want to share it with your friend Mike.

Select the file on [drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com), then right-click and find the "Share..." option.

Add Mike's email and send him an invitation.

When we switch to Mike's Google Drive we can see that the Balsamiq file appears in "Shared with me" and he can see a preview of it.

If the person you are sharing with already has Mockups for Google Drive installed they can just double-click on the file to open it and start editing. You can even [work on the same file file at the same time](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1559682#collaborating). If they don't already have it installed, continue to the next section.

## Installing and Opening 

If Mike has never installed Mockups for Google Drive, this is what he'll see when he tries to open the file.

If he clicks on the "Open with" link at the top he will get a list of suggested apps, with Balsamiq Mockups 3 at the top.

Clicking the link for Balsamiq Mockups 3 will ask for permission to connect with Google Drive.

After clicking "Accept," Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive will be installed and the project that was shared will open.

Mike can now edit this file, even [collaborating in real time](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1559682#collaborating) with anyone who it is shared with.
