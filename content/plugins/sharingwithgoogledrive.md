This document shows a series of screenshots that illustrate the experience of sharing a project via Balsamiq for Google Drive, both from the perspective of the sharer and a collaborator who doesn't have Balsamiq for Google Drive installed.

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** If you both have Balsamiq for Google Drive installed, you just need to follow the steps in the first section of this article or see [these instructions in the Balsamiq for Google Drive User Guide](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/wireframes/drive-files/#sharing-via-google-drive).{{% /alert %}}

## Sharing

Let's say you created a project called My Awesome Website.bmpr and want to share it with your friend Mike.

Select the file on [drive.google.com](https://drive.google.com), then right-click and find the "Share..." option.

Add Mike's email and send him an invitation.

When we switch to Mike's Google Drive we can see that the Balsamiq file appears in "Shared with me" and he can see a preview of it.

If the person you are sharing with already has Balsamiq for Google Drive installed they can just double-click on the file to open it and start editing. You can even [work on the same file file at the same time](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/wireframes/collaborating/). If they don't already have it installed, continue to the next section.

## Installing and Opening

If Mike has never installed Balsamiq for Google Drive, this is what he'll see when he tries to open the file.

If he clicks on the "Open with" link at the top he will get a list of suggested apps, with Balsamiq Wireframes at the top.

Clicking the link for Balsamiq Wireframes will ask for permission to connect with Google Drive.

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** You may be asked to select an account to use prior to this step. If so, make sure to select the account associated with the email that the file was shared with.{{% /alert %}}

After clicking "Accept," Balsamiq for Google Drive will be installed and the project that was shared will open.

Mike can now edit this file, even [collaborating in real time](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/wireframes/collaborating/) with anyone who it is shared with.
