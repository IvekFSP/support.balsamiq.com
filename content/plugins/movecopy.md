Sometimes you might want to copy or move a wireframe from one Google Drive project to another. To do so, follow the steps below:

1.  Open the two projects (each in its own browser tab or window)
2.  In the source project, select the wireframe you want to copy or move.
3.  In the Project menu, select Export > wireframe to JSON. This will put a text-based representation of the wireframe in the clipboard.
4.  In the target project, select Import > wireframe JSON... from the Project menu.
5.  In the Import wireframe dialog that pops up, paste the contents of the clipboard with CTRL+V and click the Import button.

That's it! You may now delete the wireframe from the source project if you wish.
