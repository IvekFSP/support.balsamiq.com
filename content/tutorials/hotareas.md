Sometimes in Mockups you want to make multiple UI controls linkable all at once, or want to add linking to controls that don't natively support it.

In this quick tutorial we'll teach you how to use the Canvas control to create a "hot linkable area" to solve the problem.

As an example, we'll add linking capability to the Bar Chart control
