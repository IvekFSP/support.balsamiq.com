This tutorial will show how you can use Confluence as a design library for custom Mockups controls or symbols. This can be used as a substitute for Symbols in Mockups for Confluence or as a way to ensure consistency across designs if there are multiple people in your organization who use Mockups for Confluence.

This video demonstrates the process. The screenshots below provide an overview of the steps performed in the video.

## 1\. Create the Controls

![Create the Controls](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/Creating_a_Mockups_Design_Library_in_Confluence/media_1386357940922.png)

Begin by choosing the controls you want to include in your library. You can either create your own controls or use controls from elsewhere, such as [Mockups To Go](https://mockupstogo.mybalsamiq.com/). In this tutorial, we'll be using the controls in the [iOS7 control set from Mockups To Go](https://mockupstogo.mybalsamiq.com/projects/ios/iOS7%20Controls).

* * *

## 2\. Select One Control and Export It to XML

![Select one Control and Export it to XML](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/Creating_a_Mockups_Design_Library_in_Confluence/media_1386358057710.png)

With a Control selected, go to File > Export Mockup XML... in the menu.

* * *

## 3\. Export Only the Selected Control

![Export only the Selected Control](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/Creating_a_Mockups_Design_Library_in_Confluence/media_1386358130763.png)

When prompted what to export, choose "Export Selected". This will copy the Mockups code to the clipboard so that you can paste it in the next step.

* * *

## 4\. Launch Confluence, Create a New Page and Add a Code Block Widget

![Launch Confluence, create a new page and add a Code Block widget](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/Creating_a_Mockups_Design_Library_in_Confluence/media_1386358778304.png)

The Code Block widget can be found under Insert > Other Macros > Code Block.

* * *

## 5\. Paste in the Copied XML Code into the Code Block

The Mockups code should be in your clipboard, so once you've added the Code Block, you can just paste inside it.

* * *

## 6\. Create a Balsamiq Mockup Using the Same XML Code

![Create a Balsamiq Mockup using the same XML code](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/Creating_a_Mockups_Design_Library_in_Confluence/media_1386359032885.png)

Using the same XML code in your clipboard create a new mockup and paste the code in the Import Mockup dialog. See the [Mockups for Confluence User Guide](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/user-guide/) for how to add Mockups to Confluence and [this guide to importing](/plugins/importtoatlassian/#import) for how to import Mockup XML.

* * *

## 7\. Save Your Mockup and Return to the Confluence Editor

![Save your mockup and return to the Confluence editor](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/Creating_a_Mockups_Design_Library_in_Confluence/media_1386358934799.png)

You should now see an image of your mockup as well as the XML code used to create it.

* * *

## 8\. Format the Page to Your Liking and Repeat the Process for Other Controls

![Format the page to your liking and repeat the process for other controls](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/Creating_a_Mockups_Design_Library_in_Confluence/media_1386360648515.png)

Watch the video above to see how to embed the Code Block inside an Embed widget to easily expand and collapse it.

## 9\. Refer to This Page Whenever You Want to Create These Controls

[![Refer to this page whenever you want to create these controls](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/Creating_a_Mockups_Design_Library_in_Confluence/media_1386360810485.png)](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/guides/Creating_a_Mockups_Design_Library_in_Confluence/media_1386360810485_lg.png "9\. Refer to this page whenever you want to create these controls")

Now you can easily access the Mockups code used to create your frequently-used controls. Use the "Import Mockup XML..." command to add these controls to your Confluence mockups. See the video for a demonstration.
