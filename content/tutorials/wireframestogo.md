This lesson will show you how to download wireframes contributed by the community from our [Wireframes To Go](https://wireframestogo.com) site and use them as [Symbols](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/symbols/) in your own wireframes. This process is the same for all of Balsamiq Wireframes products.

## How to Use It from Within the Wireframes editor

You can find the option to launch the [Wireframes to Go](https://wireframestogo.com/) browser window from either the **Project > Import Controls from Wireframes to Go** menu item, or the **More Controls** button to the right of the UI Library's categories.

Once you have launched the Wireframes to Go window, you can either browse for symbols to add to your project, or search for them.

When you have found the symbols you want to add, simply click on them. This will open them up, allowing you to take a closer look. To add them to your project, click the **Import into Project** button.

The Wireframes to Go Browser will close, and you will see a little toast message in the bottom right corner saying that the symbol has been imported. You can double check by going to the [Symbols View](#1-using-the-symbols-view), and looking for the symbols in the navigator. From there, you can view, edit, or delete them.

## How to Use It from the Web

1.  Browse the library of controls on the [site](https://wifeframestogo.com).

2.  Once you find what you need, click on the project, and click on the **Download BMPR** button.

That BMPR file has the control in it's symbol library. You can use as either the basis for a new project, or you can [move it into existing project](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/symbols/#moving-symbols)
