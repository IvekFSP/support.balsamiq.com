If you have a Mockups file that you want to use as a Symbol (a file [downloaded from Mockups To Go](/tutorials/mockupstogo/), for example), here's how you can add it to Balsamiq Mockups for Desktop as a Project Asset.

{{% alert info %}}**Note:** For [Balsamiq Mockups 3](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/intro/), follow [**these instructions**](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/110439#importing) instead.{{% /alert %}}

## 1\. Locate the Mockups file on your computer

If you downloaded it from Mockups To Go, it may be in your Downloads folder.

## 2\. Open the folder containing the mockups you'd like to use the symbol with

In this example, I want the Symbols to be available to the mockups in my "Website Redesign" project.

## 3\. Create a folder named "assets" inside that folder

Note: this folder may already exist. If so, skip this step.

## 4\. Move the Mockups file to the "assets" folder

You don't need to open the file. The next steps show how to access it.

## 5\. Open any Mockups file in the project folder

Balsamiq Mockups checks for a the presence of a sub-folder called "assets" in any mockup that's open, so it will recognize that there is now an assets folder with a Mockups file in it.

## 6\. Look in the Project Assets category for the Symbol(s) you've added

**That's it!** You can now add them to the canvas just like other controls. They will also be available in the All category as well as from the Quick Add search box.
