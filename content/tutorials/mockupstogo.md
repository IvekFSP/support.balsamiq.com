This lesson will show you how to download mockups contributed by the community from our [Mockups To Go](https://mockupstogo.mybalsamiq.com) site and use them as [Symbols](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/symbols/) in your own mockups. This process is the same for both Mockups for Desktop and myBalsamiq. Symbols are not yet supported in all versions of Mockups. See [this table](https://balsamiq.com/products/compare/) for details.

You will see two special projects at the beginning, one with instructions and another where you can upload your own mockups to share with the community.The rest of the projects are categories of mockups that other people have created that are available for download.

Depending on your browser, this should either ask you where you want to save the file or save it automatically to your Downloads folder.

To use the file, read the following instructions, depending on which Balsamiq product you have.
