Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop is not supported on Linux, but we [have heard](http://deshack.net/install-balsamiq-mockups-in-debianubuntu/) that it runs well via [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/).

Linux users might also be interested in trying [myBalsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/mybalsamiq), our browser-based version, which only requires a modern browser and the Flash Player.
