Simply head over to the [Download page](https://balsamiq.com/download) and install Mockups for Desktop on top of your existing installation.

You won’t have to re-register.

To know what changed, take a look at the [Release Announcements](http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/category/release-announcements/) category on our blog.

If you’re the adventurous type, you can test our latest build in the [Next Release Preview](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/next), but don’t use it to work on mission critical work. You may encounter bugs.
