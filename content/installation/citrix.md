From what we know about Citrix, you won't have any trouble installing and registering Mockups 3 for Desktop on it or on any other virtual environment. You may even find [this FAQ on silent installation](https://support.balsamiq.com/installation/silentinstall/) helpful.

Please keep in mind that you will need to purchase a [Mockups 3 for Desktop volume license](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#dv) for the total number of users who will be accessing our app within your Citrix environment. [Our licensing is by assigned users](https://support.balsamiq.com/sales/userscounted/), rather than concurrent users. It will be your companyâ€™s responsibility to make sure you are in compliance with our [EULA](https://balsamiq.com/eulas/), and that only the users you have assigned have access to use our software.

[Here is a little more information](https://support.balsamiq.com/sales/discounts/#discounts-when-purchasing-multiple-mockups-for-desktop-licenses) on our volume pricing and how to purchase it.
