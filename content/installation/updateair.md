As of January 2011, we rely on Adobe Air 2.5, which runs on [these operating systems](http://www.adobe.com/products/air/systemreqs/). If you are on OS X 10.5, on a PowerPC based mac, and are trying to update Mockups, we are keeping version 2.0.10 around for you [here](https://balsamiq.com/download/archives/?prefix=mockups-desktop/2.0/). Thatâ€™s the last version we made that only requires Adobe Air 1.5, which does run on PowerPC macs.

Adobe provides an installer for Air 1.5 [here](http://airdownload.adobe.com/air/mac/download/1.5.3/AdobeAIR.dmg). One thing we can suggest, short of considering getting a newer computer, is to look at myBalsamiq, our web-based version with nothing to install.
