If you get an error message saying "The application cannot be installed due to a certificate problem" or "The certificate does not match the installed application certificate," or something similar, this page is for you. It happens sometimes if you haven’t updated Mockups in a long time.

The solution is to [uninstall Mockups](/installation/uninstall/) and install it again. You won’t have to re-register.
