*   On Windows: use “Add/Remove Programs” from your Control Panel and uninstall Balsamiq Mockups 3
*   On Mac OS X: simply delete the “Balsamiq Mockups 3” file from your Applications directory. Make sure you empty the trash too!

After uninstalling, download the new version from [our download page](https://balsamiq.com/download/), it should install fine and keep all of your old settings.
