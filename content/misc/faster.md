Hello from the whole Balsamiq team!

Every now and then we're asked if we can release updates faster. We understand that it can be frustrating if the speed to get things implemented isn't as fast as customers want it to be.

The push to take funding and grow faster is tempting, but we're trying to grow organically and do the right thing, while focusing on executing. The issue of growth is one that we take seriously, but we don't want to grow for the sake of pushing features out faster. We've seen too many of the independent software vendors like us agree to get take funding, eventually get purchased by larger corporations, and eventually the founders are forced out to leave the product and customers behind.

While growing faster may help to get features out the door faster, it may not do much for the sustainability of the product vision and company, and that's something we're very serious about.
