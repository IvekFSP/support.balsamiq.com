For testing, follow [this tutorial on user-testing your iPad wireframes](/tutorials/ipad/). There are also several [products that allow you to test your prototypes](/resources/extensions/#user-testing-your-mockups) created with myBalsamiq or from a clickable PDF.

## Can I Use the Online Version (myBalsamiq) on My iPad?

The Balsamiq Mockups editor relies on Adobe Flash, so you can't edit your wireframes on your iPad. You can, however, browse your projects and view the wireframes in [myBalsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/mybalsamiq/). [Prototype view](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/sharing/#send-them-a-prototype-view-link) also works, if you want to user-test your mockups on an iPad.
