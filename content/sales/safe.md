We take credit card security seriously.

For this reason, we at Balsamiq never, ever have access to your full credit card information ([more info](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/479296).) We are able to see some details about the transaction for reference, such as the last four digits of your credit card number, but not your full card information or CVC (security code).

Instead, we use an integration with a card processor called [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). Security is one of their biggest considerations ([more info](https://stripe.com/help/security).)

If you are purchasing a Balsamiq license (for our products **Mockups 3 for Desktop**, **Mockups for Confluence** or **Mockups for JIRA**) from our website, you will be purchasing directly via Stripe. No credit card information passes or is stored on our servers.

If you instead are purchasing a Balsamiq subscription (for our products **Mockups 3 for Google Drive** or **myBalsamiq**) your card number will be collected and stored [securely](https://subs.pinpayments.com/info/faq) by a subscription management service called [Pin Payments](https://subs.pinpayments.com/) for automatic renewals via Stripe.

If you have any additional concerns or questions, be sure to [let us know](mailto:sales@balsamiq.com?subject=I have questions about credit card security.)!
