Unfortunately, we do not yet offer company-wide subscriptions for Mockups 3 for Google Drive. Each user will need to purchase a subscription individually for either $5/month or $50/year. [Click here](/sales/gdrivesubscription/#signing-up-for-a-subscription) to find out how.

However, if you are looking for a tool for your entire company, you might consider our web application, myBalsamiq. It offers unlimited users, and has additional collaborative features for teams working together. You can start a free 30-day trial [here](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/mybalsamiq).

Plans [start](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#myb) as low as $12/month.
