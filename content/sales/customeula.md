One of the reasons Balsamiq can keep costs down on our products is because we standardize everything. Thus, no need for legal teams.

We have made an effort to make our [EULA and Terms of Service](https://balsamiq.com/eulas) as fair as possible, and never negotiate it.

For this same reason, we also do not sign additional agreements, including Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs).

Our terms have been agreed to by over [150,000 customers](https://balsamiq.com/company/customers).
