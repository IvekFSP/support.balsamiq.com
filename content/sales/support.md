Customer Service is something we like to compete on.

Support is offered through [our website](http://support.balsamiq.com), our [community forums](http://forums.balsamiq.com/), as well as [email](https://balsamiq.com/company#contact), depending on which product you purchased and your maintenance status ([details](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1485219#when)).

We have people in Central European, US Central and US Pacific time zones, who generally work Monday through Friday.

We try to answer most inquiries within 24 hours during weekdays, and we're usually much faster than that.

We are also of course always on call to respond to service interruptions, both for our website and our web applications. You can see our uptime records [here](http://stats.pingdom.com/dav3wniwmzif).
