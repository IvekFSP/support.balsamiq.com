From what we know about Citrix, you won't have any troubles installing and registering Mockups 3 for Desktop there, however [this FAQ](https://support.balsamiq.com/installation/silentinstall/) on silent installation may be helpful!

Just purchase a Mockups 3 for Desktop volume license for the total number of users who will be using our app via your Citrix server.

Please note, our licensing is [by assigned users](https://support.balsamiq.com/sales/userscounted/), rather than concurrent users. It will be your companyâ€™s responsibility to make sure you are in compliance with our EULA, and that only the users you have assigned have access to use our software.

[Here](https://support.balsamiq.com/sales/discounts/#discounts-when-purchasing-multiple-mockups-for-desktop-licenses) is a little more information on our volume pricing and how to purchase it.
