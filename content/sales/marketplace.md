## What is Atlassian Marketplace?

Launched at Atlassian Summit 2012, [Atlassian Marketplace](https://plugins.atlassian.com/) is Atlassian's _app store_ for plugins and extensions. Marketplace is the preferred way to purchase plugins and extensions. You buy from Atlassian directly, and Atlassian shares the revenue with the maker of the plugin.

Learn more about Atlassian Marketplace [here](http://www.atlassian.com/licensing/marketplace).

## Are Balsamiq plugins available on Atlassian Marketplace?

Yes. Direct links below:

*   [Mockups for Confluence](https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.confluence.plugins.mockups)
*   [Mockups for JIRA](https://plugins.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.jira.plugins.mockups)

## Who should I buy the plugin from?

**[Atlassian Cloud](/sales/atlassiancloud/) users**: you should purchase directly from our website.

**Altassian Server users**: although our goal is to eventually transition all of our plugin customers to Marketplace, at the moment you have a choice. You can either buy from Marketplace or buy from us directly.

If you chose to purchase directly from Balsamiq, you can do so directly on our website:

*   [Mockups for Confluence](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#c)
*   [Mockups for JIRA](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#j)

While pricing and maintenance terms are very similar, each option has its pros and cons.

## What are the pros and cons of buying from Atlassian Marketplace?

NOTE: this option is not available for Atlassian Cloud users. Purchase from [our website](/sales/atlassiancloud/) instead.

**PROs:**

*   Buying from Atlassian Marketplace means only dealing with Atlassian instead of having to deal with two separate vendors.
*   You will buy from Atlassian, with the same terms and purchasing system you've already used to buy Confluence or JIRA.
*   You can synchronize your Balsamiq renewal dates with your other licenses.
*   Purchase more than one year of maintenance at a time.
*   We think that using Marketplace is the future and are working towards a feature where all of our Atlassian plugin customers go through Atlassian Marketplace. We are not migrating existing customers at the moment (see [below](#existing)) but we plan to do so when Atlassian is ready. If you buy from Marketplace now you'll save yourself the headache of switching in the future.

**CONs:**

*   At the moment, if you purchase from Balsamiq, your Confluence or JIRA license tier doesn't have to match the license tier of our plugins (i.e. you can install a 10-editor Mockups for Confluence plugin on a 100-user Confluence installation). This level of freedom is not available on Marketplace, at least at the moment. If you'd like this to be added to Marketplace, [tell Atlassian](mailto:sales@atlassian.com?subject=Allow non-matching tiers for Marketplace plugins)!

## What are the pros and cons of buying from Balsamiq?

**PROs:**

*   At the moment, if you purchase from Balsamiq, your Confluence or JIRA license tier doesn't have to match the license tier of our plugins (i.e. you can install a 10-editor Mockups for Confluence plugin on a 100-user Confluence installation). Note that unless Atlassian adds this same level of freedom to Marketplace, we plan on requiring tier matching in the future as well.

**CONs:**

*   We are another vendor to deal with.
*   We have our own purchasing system.
*   You get separate bills, on separate schedules.
*   We think that using Marketplace is the future and are working towards a feature where all of our Atlassian plugin customers go through Atlassian Marketplace. If you buy from us now, you should know that we'll likely migrate you to Marketplace in the future (of course we'll give plenty of advanced warning and do our best to make the transition easy).

## I'm an existing customer, buying from Balsamiq. What changes for me?

Your existing license will continue to work. You can continue purchasing upgrades and maintenance licenses from Balsamiq, and some customers have an option to [migrate to Marketplace](/sales/marketplace/#i-m-an-existing-customer-can-i-move-to-marketplace).

While we will take steps to encourage customers to migrate to Marketplace as Atlassian improves its offering, we are committed to continue to sell maintenance and upgrade licenses to our existing customers directly until January 10, 2016.

## I'm an existing customer, can I move to Marketplace?

Yes! If you are using Mockups for Confluence or Mockups for JIRA on your own server, and you have a matching license, or are willing to upgrade your Balsamiq license to match your server levels, then you can migrate your Balsamiq-issued license to Atlassian Marketplace. Details are [here](/sales/atlassianmigrating/).

## How do I enter my Marketplace or Balsamiq plugin license now?
