Please read this document carefully before accessing or using the Balsamiq Mockups Hosted Plugin.

* * *

#### Introduction [#](#intro)

##### English, not Legalese[#](#english)

Most Terms of Use and Privacy Policy documents are unreadable. They are written by lawyers and for lawyers, and in our opinion are not very effective.

Because **we believe in establishing long-term relationships with our customers**, we decided to use plain English instead, to make our terms as clear as possible.

Please don't forget that we are real people: take a look at [our company page](https://balsamiq.com/company) to get to know us a little. We are not perfect, but we're trying our hardest, because we genuinely care about your success.

When you read _Balsamiq_ or _we_ below, it refers to Balsamiq Studios, LLC ([contact information](https://balsamiq.com/company)), its affiliates (including our parent company [Balsamiq SRL](http://www.balsamiq.it)) and agents.

Should you have other questions or concerns about this document, please call us at +1 (415) 367-3531 or send us an e-mail at [sales@balsamiq.com](mailto:sales@balsamiq.com?subject=myBalsamiq%20ToS%20Question).

##### What is the Balsamiq Mockups Plugin in a Hosted Environment?[#](#whatis)

Balsamiq makes different versions of Balsamiq Mockups. Some you install, some you use online, some you install as a plugin behind your firewall. Different versions have different License Agreement and Terms of Use.

This document describes the Terms of Use for those versions of Balsamiq Mockups that are used as a plugin to a web application that is hosted in the cloud.

More specifically, these products:

*   Balsamiq Mockups for Confluence when run in Atlassian Cloud
*   Balsamiq Mockups for JIRA when run in Atlassian Cloud
*   Balsamiq Mockups for FogBugz when run in FogBugz On Demand
*   Balsamiq Mockups for Google Drive
*   Balsamiq Mockups when used on ux.stackexchange.com

When using the Plugin on a server that you host yourself behind the firewall, other terms apply: you can find the EULA [here](https://www.balsamiq.com/eulas).

Our web application, myBalsamiq, has [its own Terms of Service](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/tos/).

##### Using Balsamiq Mockups as a plugin in a hosted environment means accepting these terms[#](#useisaccept)

By accessing or using the Balsamiq Mockups in a hosted environment in any way, you agree to and are bound by the terms and conditions written in this document.

If you do not agree to all of the terms and conditions contained in this document, do not use the Balsamiq Mockups Plugin.

##### This is a living document[#](#living)

This is a living document. With your help, we want to make it the best in the industry.

If you read something that rubs you the wrong way, or if you think of something that should be added, please get in touch! We're all ears! Email [peldi@balsamiq.com](mailto:peldi@balsamiq.com?subject=myBalsamiq%20ToS) and we'll chat.

We don't amend this document for any particular customer, but if your changes apply to all of our customers, we'll be happy to update it for everyone. Scroll [to the bottom](#history) to see the history so far.

We will likely improve this document over time. By continuing to use the Plugin, you will implicitly accept the changes we make.

Your access and use of the Balsamiq Mockups Plugin is always subject to the most current version of this document.

If you'd like to be notified every time we make a change to this document, please enter your email address below to subscribe to our "Balsamiq Mockups Hosted Plugin ToS changes" mailing list:

##### Breach of Terms[#](#breach)

If you breach any of the terms and conditions in this document, your authorization to access or use the Balsamiq Mockups Plugin automatically terminates.

* * *

#### Support[#](#support)

The following versions of the Balsamiq Mockups Plugin are supported by Balsamiq when it's run as part of:

*   Balsamiq Mockups for Confluence when run in Atlassian Cloud
*   Balsamiq Mockups for JIRA when run in Atlassian Cloud
*   Balsamiq Mockups for FogBugz when run in FogBugz On Demand

Support is provided via our Community Forums at [http://forums.balsamiq.com](http://forums.balsamiq.com) as well via our support portal at [http://support.balsamiq.com](http://support.balsamiq.com)

The Balsamiq Mockups Plugin is supported by the platform vendor when it's run as part of:

*   Balsamiq Mockups when used on ux.stackexchange.com - supported by StackExchange via [meta.ux.stackexchange.com](http://meta.ux.stackexchange.com)

* * *

#### Access to your data [#](#access)

##### What personal data do you collect and why?

We collect the following personal data:

Name
Company Name
E-mail address
Billing Address

We do not collect credit card information directly. See [Who can see my credit card number?](#ccnumber) below.

We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties.

Please be aware that your browser must be enabled to accept cookies from the domain you access the Balsamiq Mockups Plugin from in order for you to use the Plugin.

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above.

##### Who can see my password?[#](#password)

The Balsamiq Plugin does not request a password of its own, and it does not have access to the platform's password.

##### Who can see my credit card number?[#](#ccnumber)

No-one at Balsamiq. If you bought the Plugin from a platform vendor, please refer to their Terms of Use. If you bought it from us (Balsamiq Mockups for FogBugz On Demand or Balsamiq Mockups for Google Drive), we use the very trustworthy and secure [Pin Payments](https://subs.pinpayments.com/) and [Stripe](https://stripe.com) payment services. Read about their security measures on the [Pin Payments Terms and Conditions](https://pin.net.au/terms) and [Stripe Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/terms) (in short, they encrypt your credit card info).

##### Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy[#](#children)

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

##### How can I access or correct my information?[#](#update)

If you purchased from us, [this article](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/131245) explains how to access and edit your information depending on what product you purchased. Otherwise please refer to the platform's Terms of Use documents.

##### Who can see my wireframes?[#](#see)

The Balsamiq Mockups Plugin follows the access control rules of the platform itself. In other words, if you attach a wireframe made with the Plugin to a wiki page or a bug report, only the platform users who have access to that wiki page or bug report will be able to see it.

If you notice this not being the case, please report the bug to us following the guidelines [below](#whitehat).

Balsamiq staff does not have access to your wireframes, unless you specifically grant us access to them via your platform.

##### How is my data protected from another customer's data? How is my data protected from hacker attacks?[#](#othercustomers)

The Balsamiq Mockups Plugin does not save your wireframes in its own database, but instead relies on the hosting platform's data storage capabilities. For instance, Balsamiq Mockups for Confluence saves the wireframes as attachments to the wiki page you add wireframes to, or Mockups for Google Drive stores your wireframes as bmml files in your Google Drive.

In other words, the Plugin offloads the problem of protecting your data to the platform itself. The Plugin doesn't make it any more or less private or secure.

##### What should I do if I find a security vulnerability in the Balsamiq Mockups Plugin?[#](#whitehat)

If you have discovered a security concern, please email us at [security@balsamiq.com](mailto:security@balsamiq.com). We’ll work with you to make sure that we understand the scope of the issue, and that we fully address your concern. We consider correspondence sent to [security@balsamiq.com](mailto:security@balsamiq.com) our highest priority, and work to address any issues that arise as quickly as possible.

Please act in good faith towards our users’ privacy and data during your disclosure. We won’t take legal action against you if you act accordingly: White hat researchers are always appreciated.

#### Intellectual Property Rights[#](#ip)

##### Who owns Balsamiq Materials?[#](#balsamiqip)

Balsamiq Materials are all the information, data, documents (e.g. white papers, press releases, datasheets, FAQs, etc.), communications, downloads, files, text, images, photographs, graphics, videos, webcasts, publications, content, tools, resources, software, code, programs and products on balsamiq.com or available via the the Balsamiq Mockups Plugin produced by Balsamiq.

Balsamiq Materials are protected by copyrights, trademarks, patents, trade secrets and all other intellectual property and proprietary rights, and any unauthorized use of the Balsamiq Materials may violate such laws and the Terms of Use.

You agree not to copy, republish, frame, download, transmit, modify, adapt, create derivative works based on, rent, lease, loan, sell, assign, distribute, display, perform, license, sublicense or reverse engineer the Balsamiq Materials or any portions of them.

You agree that you will not decompile, reverse engineer or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Balsamiq Mockups Plugin software. Any copying or redistribution of the software is prohibited, including any copying or reproduction of the software to any other server or location for further reproduction, redistribution or use on a service bureau basis. Any unauthorized use, copying or distribution of the software is expressly prohibited by law, and may result in severe civil and criminal penalties. Violators will be prosecuted to the maximum extent possible.

The trademarks, logos and service marks displayed on balsamiq.com or available via the Balsamiq Mockups Plugin are the property of Balsamiq Studios, LLC or other third parties. You are not permitted to use them without the prior written consent of Balsamiq Studios, LLC or such third party that may own the Marks. Balsamiq and the Balsamiq logo are trademarks of Giacomo Guilizzoni, licensed to Balsamiq Studios, LLC.

*   Balsamiq Materials may not be modified or altered in any way.

##### Who owns the IP of my wireframes and assets?[#](#wireframesip)

Balsamiq does not claim intellectual property rights over wireframes created with the Balsamiq Mockups Plugin.

You acknowledge and agree that Balsamiq has no liability of any kind should anyone you granted access to your content modify, destroy, corrupt, copy or distribute it, or violate the Terms of Use or other limitations that you may impose on the use of your shared content.

* * *

#### Reliability[#](#reliability)

##### Do you guarantee that the Balsamiq Mockups Plugin will be accessible at all times?[#](#sla)

In the cases below, we do not host the Balsamiq Mockups Plugin ourselves, so you should refer to the platform's Terms of Use (linked below) instead.

*   Balsamiq Mockups for Confluence when run in Atlassian Cloud - [Terms of Use](http://www.atlassian.com/hosted/terms)
*   Balsamiq Mockups for JIRA when run in Atlassian Cloud - [Terms of Use](http://www.atlassian.com/hosted/terms)
*   Balsamiq Mockups for FogBugz when run in FogBugz On Demand - [Terms of Service](https://shop.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/hostedtos.asp)
*   Balsamiq Mockups when used on ux.stackexchange.com - [Terms of Service](http://stackexchange.com/legal)

For Balsamiq Mockups for Google Drive, we do not guarantee continuous access to the Plugin. Like all other cloud-based applications, we are vulnerable to the inherent unreliability of the Internet.

That said, high reliability is something we are proud of and something we deliberately chose to compete on. That's why we have hired developers, system administrators and support staff both in California and Europe.

We monitor Mockups for Google Drive closely and have set up automated alarms to be notified (via email and SMS) when the service is under stress, so that we can deal with the issue before it becomes a problem that might impact customer access.

You can see for yourself how we're doing on this front by looking at this [Pingdom](http://www.pingdom.com)-powered chart (click for more info):

In the event of your or others’ access to or use of the Balsamiq Mockups Plugin in connection with the transmission of spam unsolicited e-mail or postings in violation of these Terms of Use, you acknowledge and agree that Balsamiq would be irreparably harmed thereunder and that monetary damages would be an insufficient and ineffective remedy; therefore you agree that Balsamiq is entitled to obtain immediate injunctive relief against any such transmission (in addition to all other remedies available at law or in equity). Balsamiq may without restriction block, filter or delete unsolicited e-mail.

##### Restriction and Termination of Use[#](#termination)

The Balsamiq Mockups Plugin may include links that will take you to other sites outside of balsamiq.com or the hosting platform. The linked sites are provided by Balsamiq to you as a convenience and the inclusion of the links do not imply any endorsement by Balsamiq of any linked site. Balsamiq has no control of the linked sites and you therefore acknowledge and agree that Balsamiq is not responsible for the contents of any linked site, any link contained in a linked site or any changes or updates to a linked site. You further acknowledge and agree that Balsamiq is not responsible for any form of transmission (e.g. webcasting) received from any linked site.

The Terms of Use and other rules, guidelines, licenses and disclaimers posted via the Balsamiq Mockups Plugin or in connection with the Materials and Services constitute the entire agreement between Balsamiq and you with respect to your access to or use of the Balsamiq Mockups Plugin and materials superseding any prior agreements between you and Balsamiq on such subject matter (including any prior versions of the Terms of Use). Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that any terms set forth in the Terms of Use expressly contradict any terms of a written agreement between you and Balsamiq regarding the use of specific Services or Materials (including Service-specific terms of use and Software-specific licenses) (“Executed Agreement”), such contradictory terms set forth in the Executed Agreement shall govern. You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use other Balsamiq services, third party content or third party software. You may not assign or otherwise transfer the Terms of Use nor any right granted hereunder without Balsamiq’s prior written consent. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Terms of Use, or portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties as reflected by that provision, and the remainder of the Terms of Use shall continue in full force and effect. Any failure by Balsamiq to enforce or exercise any provision of the Terms of Use or related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. The section titles used in the Terms of Use are purely for convenience and carry with them no legal or contractual effect.
