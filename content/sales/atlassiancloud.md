Yes. Both Mockups for Confluence and Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud work in Atlassian Cloud (formerly called Atlassian OnDemand). Installation and purchasing is different for the two plugins.

## Mockups for Confluence

Mockups for Confluence comes pre-installed in Atlassian Cloud.  Licensing works similar to our plugins for Confluence Server, however licenses for Cloud users must be purchased directly from [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#c).

Details can be found in the [Mockups for Confluence Cloud Admin Guide](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/admin-guide-cloud/).

## Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud

Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud is a connect add-on, and installed and sold directly in Atlassian Marketplace. This plugin cannot be purchased directly from Balsamiq.

Details can be found in the [Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud Admin Guide](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/admin-guide-cloud/).

{{% alert warning %}}**Note:** Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud was released January 18, 2016.  We will soon be moving all JIRA Cloud instances to this new connect add-on, however, in the meantime, you may be using an older version of the plugin. Please see the [Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud Transition Guide](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/transition-guide/).{{% /alert %}}
