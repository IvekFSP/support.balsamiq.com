Yes. Mockups for Confluence and Mockups for JIRA come pre-installed on Atlassian Cloud (formerly called Atlassian OnDemand).

Licensing works similar to using our plugins with Confluence or JIRA Server, however licenses for Cloud users must currently be purchased directly from Balsamiq. Server customers also have the option to purchase via [Atlassian Marketplace](/sales/marketplace/).

#### Installing the plugins

Our plugins come pre-installed on Atlassian Cloud. The Cloud administrator can enable the plugin by selecting "Add-ons" in the Administration menu, then under "Manage add-ons," find Balsamiq Mockups, and select "Enable".

Your 30 day trial period will start when you enable the plugin.

#### Trial period

You can use the plugin for free for 30 days from the time you first enable it. Contact [sales@balsamiq.com](mailto:sales@balsamiq.com?subject=onDemand trial extension) if you would like a trial after the first 30 days.

#### Purchasing

You can purchase licenses on our buy page for [Mockups for Confluence](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#c) and/or [Mockups for JIRA](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#j).

When purchasing, you can pick how many editors you want to support. An editor is someone who can add and edit mockups. Everyone else who has access to your Atlassian Cloud account will be able to see the mockups, free of charge.

Mockups for Confluence and Mockups for JIRA are two separate products, so if you want your Cloud users to be able to add mockups to both the Confluence wiki and the JIRA bug tracker, you'll have to buy two separate licenses.

#### Registering

Log in as the Cloud administrator and go to the Administration menu.

To Register, select "Add-ons" in the Administration menu, then under "Manage add-ons," find Balsamiq Mockups, and select "Configure"

This is what you'll see in **JIRA:**

This is what you'll see in **Confluence:**

After you select "Configure" you'll be sent to the registration screen. Copy and paste both the License Name and License Key exactly as they were sent, and select "Update".

#### Selecting Mockups editors

Instructions on how to select editors in Mockups for Confluence are [here](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/admin-guide/#selecting-mockup-editors) and in Mockups for JIRA are [here](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/admin-guide/#selecting-mockup-editors).

#### Updating the plugin

Every Atlassian Cloud customer has the same version of our plugin, updated by Atlassian whenever they push out an update to Cloud itself.

* * *

#### How maintenance works

Because updates are not optional, if you want to use our plugin inside of Atlassian Cloud, you have to make sure your [maintenance license](/sales/maintenance/) is valid. You will have to purchase a maintenance license yearly in order to keep using the plugin.

If you don't wish to renew, you can disable the plugin by going to "Manage Add-Ons" when your maintenance period ends. The mockup files will no longer be editable, however, the mockup data (and images) will still be attachments to your Confluence pages or JIRA issues.
