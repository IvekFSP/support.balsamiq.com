We do not currently support hibernating and reactivating myBalsamiq sites. We keep sites with inactive subscriptions for a minimum of [1 month](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/tos/#how-can-i-access-or-correct-my-information). After 1 month, the site data may be deleted.

If you won't be using myBalsamiq for a while you can [download all your projects](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/project/#uploading-and-downloading-projects) and create a new site when you need it again.

Alternatively, you could archive all but three of your projects and [downgrade to our smallest plan](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/project/#uploading-and-downloading-projects) (only $12/month), so that you can maintain your site data and settings for an affordable price.
