This page will describe how site owners and billing-only administrators can sign up for and make changes to a Balsamiq Cloud subscription.

* * *

## Signing up for a Subscription

Before signing up for a subscription, you must first create and confirm your Balsamiq Cloud account.

The site owners or the billing-only administrator can sign up for a plan in the Site Settings under the Billing Information section. Site Settings can be reached by selecting "Settings" in the center navigation menu within your site.

To sign up for a paid subscription, simply pick a plan and select the Subscribe button:

You can choose to be charged either monthly or yearly, then proceed to enter your credit card information in the [secure](/sales/safe/) sign-up form. Invoices will be sent via email to the site owner(s) and billing-only administrator (if applicable). Review your information and click "Subscribe" to complete the process. You are free to [cancel](#stopping-your-subscription) your subscription at any time.

## Changing Your Plan

The site owners or the billing-only administrator can change the plan at any time in the Site Settings under the Billing Information section. Site Settings can be reached by selecting "Settings" in the center navigation menu within your site.

Simply select the appropriate button or link next to the desired plan:

## Finding past Invoices

We send invoice notifications via email following your automatic credit card payment.

A link to your downloadable invoice is included in this notification email. You can also view all past invoices directly under the Billing History section of your Site Settings.

If you need to share invoices with someone other than the site owners or billing-only admin, you can easily forward the email notifications. Although you must be logged in to Balsamiq Cloud to view your Billing Information, the link to your invoice can be viewed and downloaded by your finance team without logging in.

## Updating Your Credit Card or Invoice Information

To update your credit card or invoice information, the site owners or billing-only administrator should [log in](https://balsamiq.cloud/login) to the Balsamiq Cloud site, and go to Billing Information found in the Site Settings section - which can be reached by selecting "Settings" in the center navigation menu within your site.

Here is an example of what you will see when you are on the Billing Information page of your Balsamiq Cloud site:

Select "Update Credit Card" to update the credit card and billing address for future renewals. If you only wish to update the billing address on future invoices, select "Show Address" and then "Update Address."

To edit the address shown on a previous invoice, select the specific invoice in the Billing History. You'll be able to edit and download a PDF of the transaction.

## Stopping Your Subscription

The site owners or the billing-only administrator can stop your subscription at any time in the Billing Information section, under Site Settings. Site Settings can be reached by selecting "Settings" in the center navigation menu within your site.

To stop the auto-renew of your subscription select â€œCancel Subscription". After canceling your subscription, your credit card will not be charged again, unless you restart your subscription and enter your credit card information again. Access to your Balsamiq Cloud site will end at the conclusion of the current billing period.

Please review details of your options before canceling your subscription to make sure your team [downloads](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/projects/#cloning-downloading-and-deleting-projects) any work they would like to keep.

## Restarting Your Subscription

After your subscription ends, either due to your trial ending, credit card renewal trouble, or because the time remaining on your canceled plan ended, your site will be suspended for **30 days**. During this time, staff and project members won't be able to access or use the site. However, the site owners can login and choose to permanently delete the site, download projects, or restart the subscription.

[//]: <> (test view of suspended site - looks like it might be a yellow banner "Your site is suspended because the trial period is expired. You cannot create or edit projects. Update your Billing Info or your site will be destroyed in XX days.")

If you choose not to restart the subscription, **after 30 days your site data will be deleted permanently.**
