This page will describe how space owners and billing-only administrators can sign up for and make changes to a Balsamiq Cloud subscription.

* * *

## Signing up for a Subscription

Before signing up for a subscription, you must first create and confirm your Balsamiq Cloud account.

The space owners or the billing-only administrator can sign up for a plan in the Settings under the Billing Information section. This section can be reached by selecting "Settings" in the center navigation menu within your space.

To sign up for a paid subscription, simply pick a plan and select the Subscribe button:

You can choose to be charged either monthly or yearly, then proceed to enter your credit card information in the [secure](/sales/safe/) sign-up form. Invoices will be sent via email to the space owner(s) and billing-only administrator (if applicable). Review your information and click "Subscribe" to complete the process. You are free to [cancel](#stopping-your-subscription) your subscription at any time.

* * *

## Changing Your Plan

The space owners or the billing-only administrator can change the plan at any time in the Settings under the Billing Information section. This section can be reached by selecting "Settings" in the center navigation menu within your space.

Simply select the appropriate button or link next to the desired plan:

## Finding past Invoices

We send invoice notifications via email following your automatic credit card payment to the email address of the space owner(s). The email will also be sent to the billing-only admin if one is assigned.

A link to your downloadable invoice is included in this notification email. You can also view all past invoices directly under the Billing History section of your Settings.

If you need to share invoices with someone other than the space owners or billing-only admin, you can easily forward the email notifications. Although you must be logged in to Balsamiq Cloud to view your Billing Information, the link to your invoice can be viewed and downloaded by your finance team without logging in.

If the space owners or billing-only admin need to change their registered email address, this change must be done within the corresponding [User Settings](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/user-settings/).

## Updating Your Credit Card or Invoice Information

To update your credit card or invoice information, the space owners or billing-only administrator should [log in](https://balsamiq.cloud/login) to the Balsamiq Cloud space, and go to Billing Information found in the Settings section - which can be reached by selecting "Settings" in the center navigation menu within your space.

Here is an example of what you will see when you are on the Billing Information page of your Balsamiq Cloud space:

Select "Update Credit Card" to update the credit card and billing address for future renewals. If you only wish to update the billing address on future invoices, select "Show Address" and then "Update Address."

To edit the address shown on a previous invoice, select the specific invoice in the Billing History. You'll be able to edit and download a PDF of the transaction.

* * *

## Stopping Your Subscription

The space owners or the billing-only administrator can stop your subscription at any time in the Billing Information section, under Settings. This section can be reached by selecting "Settings" in the center navigation menu within your space.

To stop the auto-renew of your subscription select "Cancel Subscription". After canceling your subscription, your credit card will not be charged again, unless you restart your subscription and enter your credit card information again. Access to your Balsamiq Cloud space will end at the conclusion of the current billing period.

Please review details of your options before canceling your subscription to make sure your team [downloads](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/projects/#cloning-downloading-and-deleting-projects) any work they would like to keep.

* * *

## Restarting Your Subscription

After your subscription ends, due to your trial ending, credit card renewal trouble, or because the time remaining on your canceled plan ended, your space will be suspended for **30 days**. During this time, your space will be in **read-only mode**, which means the projects will still be viewable to space owners and staff members, but they will not be editable.

While the space is in read-only mode, space owners will still be able to download projects, permanently delete the space or restart the subscription. If a billing-only administrator has been assigned, that person will also be able to login to restart the subscription. To do so, visit the Billing Information section within your space, found under Settings.

If you choose not to restart the subscription, **your space data will be deleted permanently after 30 days.**

* * *

## Auto-Hibernation

If you need to temporarily walk away from your subscription, but do not wish to cancel outright, you have the option to allow your space to auto-hibernate.

Auto-hibernation will automatically kick in for those paid subscriptions that meet the following criteria:

* Are on the $9/monthly plan
* The space remains empty for a full billing cycle (learn how to [Manage Your Projects](/cloud/manageprojects))

If these two requirements are met, our system will do its magic behind the scenes and will know not to charge your card for that month. Your space will remain active, along with any staff members or space owners you may have invited to join you. You will still receive an invoice for that billing cycle, which will show that you were charged $0.

If your space is currently on a different plan, and you know you won't be making use of it, you can always [change your plan](#changing-your-plan) to the $9/month one. Remember, the space must remain empty for a full billing cycle in order for auto-hibernation to take place.
