If you purchased a plugin license before June 3, 2012, your plugin users who are named editors in your Balsamiq Mockups plugin are able to activate Mockups 3 for Desktop by using your plugin License Information.

The license agreement does require you to be using the plugin in order to continue to use the Mockups 3 for Desktop activation.

If your team stops using the plugin version of Balsamiq Mockups, please uninstall Mockups 3 for Desktop from the machines of the users who received it for free because they previously were named editors in the plugin.
