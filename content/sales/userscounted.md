Balsamiq Mockups licenses are based on assigned (named) users. We do not offer concurrent (floating) licensing.

A assigned user is any individual with the permission to create and edit mockups using the application.

Additional users can be added at any time by [upgrading](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/127502) your license.

*   **Mockups 3 for Desktop**:
    *   Licenses are tied to assigned users, not particular machines. Each assigned user can install it on any machine they use regularly.
    *   [Volume licenses](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1485301-do-you-offer-any-discounts-#desktopvolume) are valid for the number of assigned users stated on the invoice/receipt.
    *   You can transfer a Mockups 3 for Desktop license from one user to another following [these instructions](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/98994).
*   **Mockups for Google Drive**: subscriptions are tied to a single Google account / email address.
*   **Mockups for Confluence** and **Mockups for JIRA**:
    *   In these plugins we call users "editors."
    *   Licenses [purchased directly from Balsamiq](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/542517#balsamiq) do not need to match your Confluence or JIRA user levels (you can, for example, register a 10-editor Mockups for Confluence license on a 500-user Confluence installation).
    *   Each Mockups for Confluence or Mockups for JIRA license is for one Confluence or JIRA instance. You will need to purchase a separate license for each Confluence or JIRA instance where users want to create and edit mockups. However, the same license can be used in both a [production and staging](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1419238) environment.
    *   Only assigned, licensed editors can create and edit mockups, but all users in your Confluence or JIRA instance will be able to view mockups for free.
    *   A assigned editor is counted towards the editor limit, whether logged in to the application or not.
    *   Instructions on how to select plugin editors are here: [Mockups for Confluence](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/admin-guide/#selecting-mockup-editors) and [Mockups for JIRA](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/admin-guide/#selecting-mockup-editors).
