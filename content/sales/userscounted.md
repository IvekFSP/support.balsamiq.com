Balsamiq Mockups licenses are based on assigned (named) users. We do not offer concurrent (floating) licensing.

An assigned user is any individual with the permission to create and edit mockups using the application.

Additional users can be added at any time by [upgrading](/sales/upgrades/) your license.

*   **Mockups 3 for Desktop**:
    *   Licenses are tied to assigned users, not particular machines. Each assigned user can install it on any machine they use regularly.
    *   [Volume licenses](/sales/discounts/#discounts-when-purchasing-multiple-mockups-for-desktop-licenses) are valid for the number of assigned users stated on the invoice/receipt.
    *   You can transfer a Mockups 3 for Desktop license from one user to another following [these instructions](/sales/licensetransfer/).
*   **Mockups for Google Drive**: subscriptions are tied to a single Google account / email address.
*   **Mockups for Confluence** and **Mockups for JIRA Server**:
    *   In these plugins we call users "editors."
    *   Licenses [purchased directly from Balsamiq](/sales/marketplace/#what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-buying-from-balsamiq) do not need to match your Confluence or JIRA Server user levels (you can, for example, register a 10-editor Mockups for Confluence license on a 500-user Confluence installation).
    *   Each Mockups for Confluence or Mockups for JIRA Server license is for one Confluence or JIRA Server instance. You will need to purchase a separate license for each Confluence or JIRA Server instance where users want to create and edit mockups. However, the same license can be used in both a [production and staging](/sales/atlassianstagingproduction/) environment.
    *   Only assigned, licensed editors can create and edit mockups, but all users in your Confluence or JIRA Server instance will be able to view mockups for free.
    *   An assigned editor is counted towards the editor limit, whether logged in to the application or not.
    *   Instructions on how to select plugin editors are here: [Mockups for Confluence](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/admin-guide/#selecting-mockup-editors) and [Mockups for JIRA Server](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/admin-guide/#selecting-mockup-editors).
*   **Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud**:
    *   Just like for most Atlassian Cloud add-ons, every user in your JIRA Cloud instance is counted as a plugin user.
