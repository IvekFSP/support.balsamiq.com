#### What is maintenance?[#](#what)

Software maintenance covers access to any [relevant support](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/127506) and [software updates](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/127505).

We release often—[about every 1-2 months](http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/category/release-announcements/)—to get bug fixes and new features in your hands as fast as possible. Then we follow up each release with [fanatical customer support](https://balsamiq.com/company/#who).

For additional details check our [End User Licensing Agreement and Terms of Service](https://balsamiq.com/eulas).

#### When does my maintenance start and end?[#](#when)

**Mockups 3 for Desktop** has no maintenance or renewal costs for the license. Minor-version (3.x) updates are free to all Desktop license holders, and we publish [new releases](http://balsamiq.com/download/) frequently. Support is provided via Balsamiq forums: [http://forums.balsamiq.com/](http://forums.balsamiq.com/)

**Mockups 3 for Google Drive** and **myBalsamiq** are subscription-based tools. Maintenance is included for as long as your subscription is active.

Software maintenance for our plugins **Mockups for Confluence** and **Mockups for JIRA** is sold for periods of 12 months at a time. The start date of the maintenance period depends on the type of purchase you are making:

*   **New license purchase:** Your 12 months of free software maintenance begins on the date of purchase.
*   **Upgrade purchase:** Your 12 months of plugin maintenance begins on the date of the [upgrade](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/127502) purchase and replaces any maintenance on the original license.
*   **Maintenance renewal purchase**: Your 12 month software maintenance will begin on the expiration date of the previous maintenance period, regardless of when the maintenance renewal was purchased.

#### What happens after the first 12 months?[#](#after)

All new licenses for Balsamiq Mockups for Confluence and Balsamiq Mockups for JIRA include 12 months of free maintenance.

[Atlassian Cloud](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/223421#maintenance) users will need to purchase maintenance support in order to continue using the plugin after the first 12 months.

Renewing maintenance is entirely optional for those who have JIRA or Confluence on their own server: you can continue to use an older version of our software if you don't wish to renew. We keep [archived versions](http://builds.balsamiq.com/archives/) of our software should you need an old version.

Renewing your software maintenance is done at your discretion and can be renewed in advance of your maintenance expiration to ensure [uninterrupted access](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1485219#when) to the support and software updates.

#### Why should I renew?[#](#why)

Renewing maintenance on your Mockups for Confluence or Mockups for JIRA license will ensure Balsamiq Mockups continues to integrate with any changes made to your plugin platform and you'll get the benefit of improvements made to the software.

We constantly improve and update our software. Check out our [release announcements](http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/category/release-announcements/) (also available as an [RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/BalsamiqReleaseAnnouncements)) to see what we have recently improved.

As [Atlassian Cloud](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/223421) features automatic updates, users are required to have active maintenance in order to continue using the plugin.

#### Can I change the license dates?[#](#changedates)

No, we do not synchronize or co-term maintenance renewal dates to coincide with other license renewals.

#### Can I upgrade/downgrade when I renew?[#](#upgrade)

Mockups for Confluence and Mockups for JIRA licenses purchased directly from Balsamiq do not need to match your Confluence or JIRA server levels.

If you'd like to upgrade to more editors when it's time to renew your maintenance, you can purchase an [upgrade license](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/127502). You can upgrade at anytime after your original purchase, as well as after your maintenance period expires.

If you'd like to downgrade to a smaller number of editors, you'll need to purchase a [new plugin license](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/542517#who) at the new level you desire.
