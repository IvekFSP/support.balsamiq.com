This is a question we get a lot and this FAQ should assist you in making the right decision for you and your team.

## Our Atlassian Plugins

Perhaps the easiest route for you and your team would be to license one of our Atlassian plugins.

* [Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.confluence/cloud/overview)
* [Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.jira/cloud/overview)
* [Mockups for Confluence Server](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.confluence.plugins.mockups) ([buy direct from Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#j))
* [Mockups for JIRA Server](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.jira.plugins.mockups) ([buy direct from Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#j))

Any of these plugins will allow your team to attach mockups directly to your Confluence pages or JIRA issues, without any fuss. Everything is built in, so your team never has to leave your Confluence/JIRA instance. It's the easiest way to mockup in Atlassian.

## myBalsamiq

Of course, there may come a time when you want to bring external collaborators onto a project, but you don't have the seats for them in your Atlassian instance. For situations like that, [myBalsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/mybalsamiq/) would be a great solution.

Because myBalsamiq is priced on a project basis, you can invite as many people as you want to collaborate on your mockups. If you want your mockups to also live in your Confluence/JIRA instance, you can [add the mockups' png to your Confluence Page or JIRA issue](https://support.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/mybandatlassian/).

myBalsamiq mockup files are completely compatible with our Confluence and JIRA plugins.

## Mockups 3 for Desktop

Finally, there is [Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/), our most popular application. It's great for single designers and entire departments alike.

Mockups 3 for Desktop allows your designers to have complete control of their projects. When they are ready to share with the rest of your team, they can attach an [exported PDF or PNG](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/exporting/) to a Confluence page or JIRA issue. If you are using [Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.confluence/cloud/overview) or [Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.jira/cloud/overview), your designers can attach the Mockups project file to the page, and the plugin will display it automatically.
