This is a question we get a lot and this FAQ should assist you in making the right decision for you and your team.

## Our Atlassian Plugins

Perhaps the easiest route for you and your team would be to license one of our Atlassian plugins.

* [Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.confluence/cloud/overview)
* [Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.jira/cloud/overview)
* [Wireframes for Confluence Server](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.confluence.plugins.mockups)
* [Wireframes for JIRA Server](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.jira.plugins.mockups)

These plugins will allow your team to attach mockups directly to your Confluence pages or JIRA issues, without any fuss. Everything is built in, so your team never has to leave your Confluence/JIRA instance. It's the easiest way to mockup in Atlassian.

If you use Confluence Server or JIRA Server you have [two purchasing options](/sales/marketplace/#what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-buying-my-server-plugin-license-from-balsamiq).  If you use Confluence Cloud or JIRA Cloud, you will need to purchase via Atlassian Marketplace. Marketplace requires that you subscribe to add-ons based on your Confluence/JIRA user tier.  For those who have a very small subset of their Confluence/JIRA users who actually need to create mockups, our plugins for Confluence/JIRA might not make financial sense.  If that is the case, one of the two options below could be a better choice for your team.

## myBalsamiq

Of course, there may come a time when you want to bring external collaborators onto a project, but you don't have the seats for them in your Atlassian instance. For situations like that, [myBalsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/mybalsamiq/) would be a great solution.

Because myBalsamiq is priced on a project basis, you can invite as many people as you want to collaborate on your mockups. If you want your mockups to also live in your Confluence/JIRA instance, you can [add the mockups' png to your Confluence Page or JIRA issue](/mybalsamiq/mybandatlassian/).


## Mockups 3 for Desktop

Finally, there is [Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/), our most popular application. It's great for teams of all sizes.

Mockups 3 for Desktop allows your designers to have complete control of their projects. When they are ready to share with the rest of your team, they can attach an [exported PDF or PNG](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/exporting/) to a Confluence page or JIRA issue.

If you have [Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.confluence/cloud/overview) or [Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.jira/cloud/overview) installed, you can attach the Mockups project file to a page or issue, and the plugin will display it automatically, even if you don't have an active trial or subscription.

If you have [Wireframes for Confluence Server](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.confluence.plugins.mockups) or [Wireframes for JIRA Server](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.jira.plugins.mockups) instances, you can use [this guide](/plugins/b3andatlassian/) to get your Mockups for Desktop projects into them.
