No, Balsamiq products are proprietary software applications.

We make use of some open-source software, as stated in our [EULA](https://balsamiq.com/eulas) appendix.

Note: Balsamiq does offer [free or discounted licenses](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/105924) for official Open Source Projects and community organizations, and [we open source some of our internal tools and libraries](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1339720) — it’s our way of giving something back. :)
