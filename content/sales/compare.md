This is a tough question that we get pretty often. While it's nearly impossible to cover *every* difference, we can certainly go over the broad strokes here. If you have questions beyond that, do not hesitate to [email us](mailto:support@balsamiq.com) so that we can answer them!

You can get a quick version of the differences from our [Compare Page](https://balsamiq.com/products/compare/).

## Editor Versions

As of this writing, we have two different versions of the Balsamiq Mockups editor (the application that you actually do the wireframing in).

First, there is [Mockups Version 3 Editor](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/intro/), the new kid on the block that we debuted with [Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/). It's been rebuilt from the ground up to facilitate new features, and an eventual shift to all native-based applications.

The other is the original Mockups Version 2 editor, that served as the engine for all of our products until recently. While it's slowly being phased out in favor of the Version 3 Editor, it still has a lot of chops. We don't update it as often as the Version 3 editor, but it still gets plenty of love - and it's as powerful as ever!

### Products Based on the Mockups Version 3 Editor

1. [Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/)
2. [Mockups 3 for Google Drive](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/user-guide/)
3. [Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/user-guide-cloud/)

Any products based on the Mockups Version 3 Editor will be updated simultaneously whenever we release a [new version](http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/).

### Products Based on the Mockups Version 2 Editor

1. [myBalsamiq](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/)
2. [Mockups for JIRA Server](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/user-guide/)
3. [Mockups for Confluence Server](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/user-guide/)

These three applications will work almost identically, save for one major difference: The Atlassian Plugins based on the Mockups Version 2 Editor (Confluence Server and JIRA Server) do not support the creation of [symbols](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/symbols/). This is due to a limitation in the way the plugins were initially implemented.

## Why Choose Mockups 3 for Desktop?

[Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/) is our flagship product (and best seller), and it just gets better with [every release](http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/).

Mockups 3 for Desktop stores your files locally, so you have complete control of them at all time. Because it's not based in a browser, it supports all of our awesome [keyboard shortcuts](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/shortcuts/). It's great for any team size, from large company to single designer, and is great for [collaboration](https://support.balsamiq.com/desktop/sharing/)!

## Why Choose myBalsamiq?

[myBalsamiq](https://www.mybalsamiq.com/signup) is a great product for large teams looking to collaborate on projects. Because every subscription is [priced by project](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#myb) (not by user or mockup), you can invite an unlimited number of people to collaborate on an unlimited amount of mockups.

From large corporations with hundreds of people working on wireframes, to a freelance designer working with their clients, myBalsamiq is a great collaboration tool.

## Why Choose Mockups 3 for Google Drive?

[Mockups 3 for Google Drive](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/balsamiq-mockups-projects/iedapplgopkgngalkbailjoikghljkki) was our first product to offer Real Time Collaboration on the same mockup, and is a fantastic tool for designers who want to work on their project anywhere.

Mockups 3 for Google Drive keeps all of your projects on your Google Drive account - so all you need a computer with a Flash-equipped browser, the internet, and you're good to go!

In addition, if any of your collaborators are Mockups 3 for Google Drive subscribers, [you will be able to work with them, in real time, on the same mockup](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/user-guide/#collaborating-with-other-users-in-real-time). This is something we debuted with Mockups 3 for Google Drive, and are bringing to all our applications in the future!

## Why Choose One of the Atlassian Plugins?

The [Atlassian plugins](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/plugins/) are fantastic because they let your team build Mockups within the framework your company already uses. Mockups for Confluence and JIRA don't require your users to log into a separate piece of software, they are built into your Confluence and JIRA instances. You can easily attach mockups to Confluence Pages and JIRA Issues without leaving your wiki or issue tracker - a completely integrated wireframing solution.
