This page will cover the differences in Editor Versions. Check out our [Compare Page](https://balsamiq.com/products/compare/) if you need a more in-depth view about each individual product.

## Editor Versions

As of this writing, we have two different versions of the Balsamiq Mockups editor (the application that you actually do the wireframing in).

First, there is [Mockups Version 3 Editor](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/intro/), the new kid on the block that we debuted with [Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/). It's been rebuilt from the ground up to facilitate new features, and an eventual shift to all native-based applications.

The other is the original Mockups Version 2 editor, that served as the engine for all of our products until recently. While it's slowly being phased out in favor of the Version 3 Editor, it still has a lot of chops. We don't update it as often as the Version 3 editor, but it still gets plenty of love - and it's as powerful as ever!

### Products Based on the Mockups Version 3 Editor

1. [Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/)
2. [Mockups 3 for Google Drive](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/user-guide/)
3. [Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/user-guide-cloud/)
3. [Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/user-guide-cloud/)

Any products based on the Mockups Version 3 Editor will be updated simultaneously whenever we release a [new version](http://blogs.balsamiq.com/product/).

### Products Based on the Mockups Version 2 Editor

1. [myBalsamiq](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/)
2. [Mockups for JIRA Server](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/user-guide/)
3. [Mockups for Confluence Server](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/user-guide/)

These three applications will work almost identically, save for one major difference: The Atlassian Plugins based on the Mockups Version 2 Editor (Confluence Server and JIRA Server) do not support the creation of [symbols](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/symbols/). This is due to a limitation in the way the plugins were initially implemented.

## Editor Differences

The main difference between the Version 2 and Version 3 editors is that the Version 3 editor will be updated more frequently. As much as we love the Version 2 editor, we hope to have all of our products on the Version 3 editor soon!
