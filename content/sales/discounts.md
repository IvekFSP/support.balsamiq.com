#### Discounts for students[#](#student)

We do not offer discounts to individual students, however we have a [free program for classroom use](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/105924#edu) you can forward on to your instructor.

Once you are a member of your teacher's myBalsamiq site, you will be able to buy a license for [Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/) for your own personal use at a [discounted rate](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/609459#desktop) ($45/user instead of $89).

#### Discounts for nonprofits[#](#nonprofits)

We do not offer discounts to nonprofits, but most nonprofit organizations will qualify for our [free software](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/105924) program.

#### Discounts for government organizations[#](#gov)

Discounts are not offered to government organizations. Government organizations purchasing Balsamiq software are required to purchase commercial licenses.

#### Discounts for resellers[#](#resellers)

While we do offer discounts for Atlassian Partners, we do not offer reseller discounts. Full information purchasing as a software reseller is found [here](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1485338).

#### Discounts when purchasing multiple mockups for desktop licenses[#](#desktopvolume)

We offer discounted pricing for Mockups 3 for Desktop via Volume Licenses. Discounts start at 5 users and increase with the number of users. Pricing can be found [here](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#dv).

Our Desktop [upgrade prices](https://balsamiq.com/buy/desktopupgrades/) are also based on our volume discounts. You receive the same volume discount whether you bought the licenses all at once, or decided to [upgrade](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/127502) to more users later.

Volume licenses also make license management easier: you'll have one single Mockups 3 for Desktop license for your total number of users.

#### Discounts when purchasing multiple versions of mockups[#](#multipleproducts)

We offer some discounts to customers who would like to use Desktop and another version of Balsamiq Mockups, no matter which product you purchase first.
