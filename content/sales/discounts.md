Yes! We have a few circumstances were you can get discounts or special pricing on our products.

## Discounts for students

We do not offer discounts to individual students, however we have a [free program for classroom use](https://balsamiq.com/free) you can forward on to your instructor.

Once you are a member of your teacher's myBalsamiq site, you will be able to buy a license for [Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/) for your own personal use at a [discounted rate](/mybalsamiq/classroom/#helping-your-students-purchase-mockups-for-desktop-at-a-discounted-price) ($45/user instead of $89).

## Discounts for nonprofits

We do not offer discounts to nonprofits, but most nonprofit organizations will qualify for our [free software](https://balsamiq.com/free) program.

## Discounts for government organizations

Discounts are not offered to government organizations. Government organizations purchasing Balsamiq software are required to purchase commercial licenses.

## Discounts for resellers

While we do offer discounts for Atlassian Partners, we do not offer reseller discounts. Full information purchasing as a software reseller is found [here](/sales/resellers/).

## Discounts when purchasing multiple mockups for desktop licenses

We offer discounted pricing for Mockups 3 for Desktop via Volume Licenses. Discounts start at 5 users and increase with the number of users. Pricing can be found [here](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#dv).

Our Desktop [upgrade prices](https://balsamiq.com/buy/desktopupgrades/) are also based on our volume discounts. You receive the same volume discount whether you bought the licenses all at once, or decided to [upgrade](/sales/upgrades/) to more users later.

Volume licenses also make license management easier: you'll have one single Mockups 3 for Desktop license for your total number of users.

## Discounts when purchasing multiple versions of mockups

We offer some discounts to customers who would like to use Desktop and another version of Balsamiq Mockups, no matter which product you purchase first.

Details on how are here:
