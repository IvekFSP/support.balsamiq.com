This page describes how you can purchase a myBalsamiq subscription as well as how to upgrade or downgrade your plan. It applies to both site owners and [secondary billing administrators](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/sitesettings/#4-designating-a-secondary-billing-administrator) (if designated).

Site owners and [secondary billing administrators](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/sitesettings/#4-designating-a-secondary-billing-administrator) are able to sign up for plans that suit their company needs, and upgrade or downgrade their plan at any time as their needs change.

**Note**: we do not support hibernating / deactivating / putting a site on hold: [details here](/sales/hibernate/).

## Signing up for a subscription

Before signing up for a subscription, you must first set up your [myBalsamiq trial site](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/mybalsamiq).

The site owner or the [secondary billing administrator](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/sitesettings/#4-designating-a-secondary-billing-administrator) can sign up for a plan in the Site Settings, under "Payment Info." Site Settings can be reach by selecting "My Info" from the main site navigation.

To sign up for a paid subscription, select the Sign Up button next to your preferred plan:

Then select your preferred payment frequency (monthly or yearly), enter your credit card information in the [secure](/sales/safe/) sign-up form, choose the site owner or [secondary billing administrator's](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/sitesettings/#4-designating-a-secondary-billing-administrator)Â email for delivery of invoices, and select "Sign Up". You are free to [cancel](#stopping-your-subscription) your subscription at any time.

## Changing your plan

**Note:** We recently changed our subscription system. If you signed up for a subscription before December 12, 2015 and have not yet migrated, see instructions for Pin Payment Subscribers below.

The site owner or the [secondary billing administrator](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/sitesettings/#4-designating-a-secondary-billing-administrator) can upgrade or downgrade, or change the payment frequency at any time in the Site Settings, under "Payment Info." Site Settings can be reach by selecting "My Info" from the main site navigation.

Simply select the appropriate button or link next to the plan:

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/myb/changeplan.png)

When changing plans, sites will automatically receive credit for any time remaining on the old plan. If additional money is required, your credit card will be charged for the remainder due. If there is any unused credit it will be applied toward future renewals.

If you are just changing your plan level, your regular billing date will not change. We will just adjust the current renewal period. Changes to payment frequency change future renewals to the date the plan was changed.

You will not be required to re-enter your credit card number and your new subscription plan will start immediately.

**Pin Payments Subscribers**

If you signed up for a subscription before December 12, 2015 and have not yet migrated, to change your billing frequency go to your "Payment Info" page as described above.

Selecting a new plan from this page will migrate you from Pin Payments to our new subscription system. You will need to re-enter your credit card to make this change. Your credit card will be managed securely by [Stripe](/sales/safe/).

A new subscription period will start when you change plans. Any unused time on your current subscription period and any subscription credit will be transferred to our new system. If additional money is required for the new subscription period, your credit card will be charged for the remainder due.

After you have migrated, any future changes to your plan will work as described above.

## Finding past invoices

**Note:** We recently changed our subscription system. If you signed up for a subscription before December 12, 2015 and have not yet migrated, see instructions for Pin Payment Subscribers below.

We send monthly invoice notifications via email following your automatic credit card payment to the email address you selected. You can choose to send invoices to either the site owner or the [secondary billing administrator](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/sitesettings/#4-designating-a-secondary-billing-administrator).

A link to your online, downloadable invoice is included in this notification email. You can also view all past invoices directly on your Payment Info page in the Billing History.

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/myb/billinghistory.png)

You can switch between the site owner and secondary billing admin emails at any time. If you need to share invoices with someone other than the site owner or secondary billing admin, you can easily forward the email notifications. Although you must be logged in to myBalsamiq to view your billing page, the link to your invoice can be viewed and downloaded by your finance team without logging in.

**Pin Payments Subscribers**

If you signed up for a subscription before December 12, 2015 and have not yet migrated, payment notifications are sent via email following your automatic credit card payment to the email address provided with your credit card billing information. However to view invoices, you'll need to access them via the Payment Info page.

You must be logged in to view your billing page, however if you need to share invoices with your financial department, the link to your invoices found on your billing page can be copied and viewed without logging in.

Changing the email address for receipts, will migrate you from Pin Payments to our new subscription system. You will need to re-enter your credit card information to make this change. Your credit card will be managed securely by [Stripe](/sales/safe/).

A new subscription period will start when you make this change. Any unused time on your current subscription period and any subscription credit will be transferred to our new system. If additional money is required for the new subscription period, your credit card will be charged for the remainder due.

After you have migrated, any future changes to your email address will work as described above.

## Updating your credit card or invoice information

**Note:** We recently changed our subscription system. If you signed up for a subscription before December 12, 2015 and have not yet migrated, see instructions for Pin Payment Subscribers below.

Billing information can by updated at any time by the site owner or the [secondary billing administrator](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/sitesettings/#4-designating-a-secondary-billing-administrator) on the Payment Info page in the Site Settings.

![](https://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/myb/billinginfo.png)

Select "Update Credit Card" to update the credit card and billing address for future renewals. If you only wish to update the billing address on future invoices, select "Update Address."

To edit the address shown on a previous invoice, select the specific invoice in the Billing History. You'll be able to edit and download a PDF of the transaction.

**Pin Payments Subscribers**

If you signed up for a subscription before December 12, 2015 and have not yet migrated, to change your credit card information select "Update Credit Card" from the Help menu, as described above.

Updating your credit card information from this page will migrate you from Pin Payments to our new subscription system. Your credit card will be managed securely by [Stripe](/sales/safe/).

A new subscription period will start when you update your card. Any unused time on your old subscription and any subscription credit will be transferred to our new system. If additional money is required for the new subscription period, your credit card will be charged for the remainder due.

After you have migrated, any future updates to your credit card or invoices will work as described above.

## Stopping your subscription

The site owner or the [secondary billing administrator](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/sitesettings/#4-designating-a-secondary-billing-administrator) can stop your subscription at any time in the Site Settings, under "Payment Info." Site Settings can be reach by selecting "My Info" from the main site navigation.

To stop your subscription select "Cancel Subscription". After canceling your subscription, your credit card will not be charged again, unless you restart your subscription and enter your credit card information again. Access to your myBalsamiq site will end at the conclusion of the current billing period.

Please review details of [your options](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/sitesettings/#administration) before canceling your subscription to make sure your team downloads any work they would like to keep.

## Restarting your subscription

After your subscription ends, either due to your trial ending, credit card renewal trouble, or because the time remaining on your canceled plan ended, your site will be suspended for 90 days. During this time, staff and project members won't be able to access or use the site, however the site owner can login and choose to permanently delete the site, download projects, or restart the subscription.

To restart the subscription during the suspended period, the site owner selects "signing up" from the suspended site page, and will be directed to the Payment Info page. The site owner can restart the subscription by selecting a plan and entering credit card information.

If you choose not to restart the subscription, after 90 days your site data will be scheduled for permanent deletion. If the site owner no longer has access to restart the site, but you cannot create a new trial site with your old site name, contact [sales@balsamiq.com](mailto:sales@balsamiq.com) and we will verify if your old site is still available for reactivation.
