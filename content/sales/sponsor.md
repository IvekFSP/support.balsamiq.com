As you can see on [this page](https://balsamiq.com/company/sponsorships/), we are proud to support our community via sponsorships.

Our sponsorship program aims to **support people who are helping others rid the world of bad software** because we want them to continue to be successful, for the benefit of our whole community.

## Approval Process (Read This First!)

We choose events based on how they fit with our sponsorship mission. We generally sponsor at a maximum of US $500, with the exception of one or two events we select each year for larger contributions. Here are some things we consider when looking at events.

*   Relevance to our mission
*   Reputation of speakers
*   Reputation of organizers and host organization
*   History of the event

**We like the packages that require little work from us.**

We list the information and assets you can use in your materials.

We don't need to distribute collateral materials. If that's a benefit of your sponsor package, we'd prefer a reduction in fees for us to NOT include collateral materials in your welcome package and swag bags. Use of our logo and company/product information is sufficient.

We usually don't need tickets to the events for ourselves. If a ticket is part of the package, we'll be happy to raffle it off to one of our customers.
