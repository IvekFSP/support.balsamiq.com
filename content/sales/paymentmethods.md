The answer depends on the version of Balsamiq Mockups:

*   [Subscriptions](#subscriptions) - myBalsamiq and Mockups 3 for Google Drive
*   [Licenses](#licenses) - Mockups 3 for Desktop, Mockups for Confluence, and Mockups for JIRA

* * *

#### Subscriptions [#](#subscriptions)

We only accept [automatic credit card payments](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/127484) for myBalsamiq and Mockups 3 for Google Drive plans. We do not accept other forms of payment for these subscription-based services.

#### Licenses [#](#licenses)

All licenses for Mockups 3 for Desktop, Mockups for Confluence, and Mockups for JIRA can be purchased by **credit card,** (including MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express) via our [secure](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1629092) online [order form](https://balsamiq.com/buy/).

We unfortunately do not accept PayPal as a form of payment, however most debit cards with a Visa or MasterCard logo (and that do not require a PIN) are accepted.

For orders of US $300 or more we also accept additional payment options. Our Terms are Net 30\. Details on how to submit your order are [here](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/127484). Once you have received your invoice, you will be able to pay using the options below.
