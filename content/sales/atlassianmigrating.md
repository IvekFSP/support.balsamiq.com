Currently, customers can purchase plugin licenses for Atlassian's Confluence and JIRA via [Atlassian Marketplace](/sales/marketplace/) or via our website. This article is designed to help customers who wish to transfer their existing Mockups for Confluence or Mockups for JIRA from Balsamiq to their myAtlassian account.

## Who is eligible to move licenses to Atlassian Marketplace?

Customers who wish to migrate their Mockups for Confluence or Mockups for JIRA license to Atlassian Marketplace must fit two requirements:

*   You must be using Confluence and/or JIRA via **Atlassian Server** (behind-the-firewall). Our plugins are not yet available in Atlassian Marketplace for [Atlassian Cloud](##i-m-using-atlassian-cloud-can-i-migrate-to-marketplace-now-cloud) (On Demand) users.
*   You must have **a matching license or be willing to upgrade to matching** in Marketplace. Currently, plugin licenses purchased directly from Balsamiq do not have to match. For example, you can register a Balsamiq-issued 10-editor Mockups for Confluence license on a 100-user Confluence installation. However, Marketplace requires that add-on licenses match server levels.

## Why should I migrate my license to Marketplace?

Once you have migrated your license to your myAtlassian account you will be able to:

*   Purchase maintenance and upgrades via Atlassian Marketplace (you'll no longer need to deal with two separate vendors, and two separate terms and purchasing systems.)
*   Synchronize your Balsamiq renewal dates with your other licenses.
*   Purchase more than one year of maintenance at a time.

## I'm using Atlassian Cloud. Can I migrate to Marketplace now?

Unfortunately, no. Mockups for Confluence and Mockups for JIRA for [Atlassian Cloud](/sales/atlassiancloud/) users are not yet available for sale in Atlassian Marketplace. Once our plugins are available for sale in Marketplace, we'll offer license migration for Cloud users. If you would like to be added to the mailing list to be notified when this migration is happening, please [contact us](mailto:sales@balsamiq.com?subject=Atlassian Cloud user interested in migrating to Marketplace&body=Please include your current Mockups for Confluence and/Mockups for JIRA license in this email, as well as the number of users you have in your Confluence and/or JIRA Cloud instance.).Â 

We will make sure you have a smooth transition to Marketplace when the time comes!
