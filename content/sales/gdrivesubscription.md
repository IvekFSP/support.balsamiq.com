#### Signing up for a Subscription[#](#signingup)

Before signing up for a subscription, you must first [install](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/user-guide/#installation) Mockups for Google Drive.

As subscriptions are tied to specific Google IDs, be sure you are logged in to the Google ID (email) with which you plan to use Mockups 3 for Google Drive.

At the end of your fully-functional [30-day trial](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/127496) period, you will be able to view existing mockups, but you will not be able to edit or create new mockups unless you sign up for a paid plan.

Mockups 3 for Google Drive is sold as a monthly or yearly subscription paid exclusively via automatic credit card payments.

To sign up for a plan, open Mockups for Google Drive by creating a [new project](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/user-guide/#creating-a-new-project) (or opening an existing one), and then select **"Sign Up for a Paid Plan"** from the Help menu.

![](http://media.balsamiq.com/img/support/docs/gdrive/userguide/help_signup.png)

If your trial has expired and you no longer have access to the editor and Help menu, simply open an existing Mockups 3 for Google Drive project, and select "Sign Up for a Paid Plan" in the notification bar at the bottom of the mockup viewer.

You will then be taken to the billing page.

You are free to [cancel your subscription](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1550556#stopplan) at any time.

That's it!
