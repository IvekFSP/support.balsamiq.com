We stopped selling Mockups for FogBugz on November 1, 2013, and support and maintenance for the plugin ended November 1, 2014.

In accordance with our EULA, existing Mockups for FogBugz on-premise customers will be able to continue using the plugin indefinitely, but they will no longer be eligible for support or updates.

As announced to customers in November 2013, we also switched off the subscriptions of Mockups for FogBugz onDemand on November 1, 2014\. The mockups will continue to be accessible for viewing in cases, however they are no longer viewable in wiki pages.

If you would like to migrate to a different tool, we suggest using [myBalsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/mybalsamiq). We are working on making myBalsamiq easy to integrate with, so that FogCreek could build an integration between our two tools in the future.

We will be happy to give existing Mockups for FogBugz customers significant discounts on myBalsamiq or Mockups 3 for Desktop if they wish to migrate their mockups there. Email [sales@balsamiq.com](mailto:sales@balsamiq.com) if you're interested.
