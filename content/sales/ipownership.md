Yes.

Balsamiq does not claim intellectual property rights over wireframes created with Balsamiq Mockups or myBalsamiq ([more info](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/tos/#who-owns-the-ip-of-my-wireframes-and-assets)).

That said, if you use images created with Balsamiq Mockups in a **book**, **eBook**, **website**, **software,** or **advertisement**, we'd appreciate a little mention, something small like this:

_<small>Created with [Balsamiq Mockups](https://balsamiq.com/).</small>_

Here's the HTML for it:

<textarea class="full" rows="2"><em><small> Created with <a href="https://balsamiq.com">Balsamiq Mockups</a>.</small></em></textarea>

Peldi's wife Mariah and our nice guy designer Mike have put a lot of love into creating those wireframe pieces, they deserve a little credit don't you think?

If instead you want to use any of the **icons** found in Balsamiq Mockups, the credit should go to <a href="http://fontawesome.io/">FontAwesome</a>. Here's a link to their very generous <a href="http://fontawesome.io/license/">license</a>.

Thanks! :)
