We follow [Atlassian's Support End of Life Policy](http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/Support/Atlassian+Support+End+of+Life+Policy), meaning that as soon as Atlassian stops supporting a certain version of Confluence or JIRA, we'll update the plugin to stop supporting that version as well.

You can check compatibility and download older versions directly in Atlasssian Marketplace for [Mockups for Confluence](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.confluence.plugins.mockups/versions) and [Mockups for JIRA.](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.jira.plugins.mockups/versions)
