No. For your added [security](/sales/safe/), we do not handle card numbers or process credit cards ourselves.

For license purchases you can pay by credit card online via our secure online form:

*   [Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/buy/)
*   [Mockups for Confluence Server](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#c)
*   [Mockups for JIRA Server](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#j)

For subscription purchases, you can sign up for a plan directly in the application:

*   [myBalsamiq](/sales/mybsubscriptions/#signing-up-for-a-subscription)
*   [Balsamiq for Google Drive](/sales/gdrivesubscription/#signing-up-for-a-subscription)
