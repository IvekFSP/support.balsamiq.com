Arg! Sorry about that. This page is here to help.

Ok, so, first we need to figure out which one of our products you are using.

Are you using the Desktop version ([Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/))? If so, _there is no password or login required for using Mockups 3 for Desktop_.  Just [download](https://balsamiq.com/download/), install and launch.

You also **don't** need a Balsamiq login or password for:

*   [Balsamiq Mockups for Confluence](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/user-guide/) - log in using your Confluence account 
*   [Balsamiq Mockups for JIRA](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/admin-guide) - log in using your JIRA account
*   [Balsamiq Mockups 3 for Google Drive](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/user-guide/) - log in using your Google or Gmail account
*   [Mockups To Go](/resources/mockupstogo/) - you can upload mockups to the [Submissions project](https://mockupstogo.mybalsamiq.com/projects/submissions/grid) and download from [any project](https://mockupstogo.mybalsamiq.com/projects) without logging in

The only product we offer that you do need a login and password for is **[myBalsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/mybalsamiq/)** - the online version of Balsamiq Mockups that we also host. If you can't remember your login or password for your myBalsamiq site, you can [reset your password here](https://www.mybalsamiq.com/forgotpassword).

If you're still having trouble, please email [support@balsamiq.com](mailto:support@balsamiq.com), preferably with the name or address of your myBalsamiq site (e.g., https://_something_.mybalsamiq.com/).

## Lost License Key
