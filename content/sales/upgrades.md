#### What is the difference between an "upgrade" and an "update"?[#](#definition)

An **upgrade** is a purchase to change from an existing license to a license for a greater number of users (or to a greater number of projects in myBalsamiq).

An **update** is when you download and install the newest version of Balsamiq Mockups. For more information on updating to new versions see [Software maintenance (support and updates)](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1485219)

#### What does it cost to upgrade to a larger license or plan?[#](#cost)

#### How can I order an upgrade?[#](#how)

You can upgrade to a larger license or plan at any time.

##### Mockups for Desktop

You will need your current License Key when ordering. You'll have one single license for the total number of users. Registered users won't have to do anything, and the new users will register with the new License Information. To purchase start [here](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#du).

##### myBalsamiq

Site owners can upgrade or downgrade at any time in their [site settings](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1397041#updatingplan). When upgrading or downgrading, sites will automatically receive credit for any time remaining on the old plan level.

##### Mockups for Confluence or JIRA

For licenses purchased directly from Balsamiq you will need your current License Key when ordering. After your purchase, replace your old License Information with the upgrade License Information.

Direct links to order: [Mockups for Confluence](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#cu) and [Mockups for JIRA](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#ju). Licenses purchased through [Atlassian Marketplace](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/542517) can be upgraded through my.atlassian.com 

Customers who originally purchased from Balsamiq and are using Mockups for Confluence or Mockups for JIRA on their own servers have an option to [migrate to Atlassian Marketplace](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1790187) before upgrading.
