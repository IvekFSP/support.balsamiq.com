From time to time, we offer promotional codes for Balsamiq Cloud which consist of an extended trial period, longer than the usual 30-day trial offered by default. These codes are strictly shared as a form of [sponsorship](https://balsamiq.com/company/sponsorships) to support events or communities that we want to see succeed, or through cross-marketing partnerships.

**Please DO NOT email us asking to share a promotional code with you.**

If you have received a promo code from us, steps on how to apply it are below.

***

## Creating a New Space

If you're new to Balsamiq Cloud, you can redeem your promo code when [creating a new space](https://docs.balsamiq.com/cloud/intro/#quick-start-guide). Before doing so, you will first [sign up](https://balsamiq.cloud/) for a new Balsamiq Cloud account.

After your account is created and verified, you will see the option to create your new Space. You will be asked to name your Space, and at the bottom of that dialog, you will see the **promo code** field where you can enter the code you received.

Make sure to select "Apply" and then "Create My Space and Start My Free Trial" to proceed. You can verify your new expiration date by visiting the **Billing Information** section, which can be reached by selecting "Settings" in the center navigation menu within your Space.

## Applying Code to Existing Space

Promo codes can also be applied to existing Spaces that are still during in active trial period. These codes **cannot** be applied to paid Spaces or expired trials or subscriptions.

To apply your code, login to your Space and visit the **Billing Information** section, which can be reached by selecting "Settings" in the center navigation menu within your Space.

Enter your promo code in the corresponding field, and then select "Apply". The text will then update to confirm the promo code has been applied correctly, and your new expiration date will appear there.
