This is a complicated question that we have gotten often. Rather than attempt to cover *everything* here, we will go over the broad strokes. If you have questions beyond that, do not hesitate to [email us](mailto:support@balsamiq.com) so that we can answer them!

## Products Based on the Mockups Version 3 Editor

Of all our online applications and plugins, three are based on the newest version of the editor. Eventually, everything will move to the Mockups Version 3 Editor, but that has been a fairly large task for our small team, so we are migrating one application at a time.

Right now, the applications that run the Mockups Version 3 Editor are:

1. [Mockups 3 for Google Drive](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/user-guide/)
2. [Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/user-guide-cloud/)
3. [Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/user-guide-cloud/)

Because they are on the Mockups Version 3 Editor, these applications will be updated day and date with our Desktop application, and have all the newest bells and whistles we have developed.

## Products Based on the Mockups Version 2 Editor

The Mockups Version 2 Editor is our older editor - but it is no slouch, and is as powerful as our Mockups Version 3 Editor in nearly every regard. That being said, applications based on the Mockups Version 2 Editor aren't updated as frequently as their Version 3 siblings.

Those applications are:

1. [myBalsamiq](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/)
2. [Mockups for JIRA Server](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/user-guide/)
3. [Mockups for Confluence Server](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/user-guide/)

These three applications will work almost identically, save for one major difference: The Atlassian Plugins based on the Mockups Version 2 Editor (Confluence Server and JIRA Server) do not support the creation of [symbols](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/symbols/). This is due to a limitation in the way the plugins were initially implemented.

## Why myBalsamiq?

myBalsamiq is a great product for large teams looking to collaborate on projects. Because it is [priced by project](https://balsamiq.com/buy/#myb), and not by user or mockup, you can invite an unlimited amount of people to collaborate on an unlimited amount of mockups.

From large corporations with hundreds of people working on wireframes, to a freelance designer working with their clients, myBalsamiq is a great collaboration tool.

## Why Mockups 3 for Google Drive?

Mockups 3 for Google Drive was our first product to offer Real Time Collaboration on the same mockup, and is a fantastic tool for designers who want to work on their project anywhere.

Mockups 3 for Google Drive stores all of it's projects and information on your Google Drive account - so all you need a computer with a Flash-Equipped browser, and you're good to go!

In addition, if any of your collaborators are Mockups 3 for Google Drive subscribers, [you will be able to work with them, in real time, on the same mockup](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/user-guide/#collaborating-with-other-users-in-real-time). This is something we debuted with Mockups 3 for Google Drive, and are bringing to all our applications in the future!
