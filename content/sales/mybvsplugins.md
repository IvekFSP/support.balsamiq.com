This is a complicated question that we have gotten often. Rather than attempt to cover *everything* here, we will go over the broad strokes. If you have questions beyond that, do not hesitate to [email us](mailto:support@balsamiq.com) so that we can answer them!

## Editor Versions

As of this writing, we have two different versions of the Balsamiq Mockups editor (the application that you actually do the wireframing in).

First, there is [Mockups Version 3 Editor](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/intro/), the new kid on the block that we debuted with [Mockups 3 for Desktop](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/). It's been rebuilt from the ground up to facilitate new features (and an eventual shift to all native-based applications).

The other is the powerful Mockups Version 2 editor, that served as the engine for all of our products until recently. While it's slowly being phased out in favor of the Version 3 Editor, it still has a lot of chops. We don't update it as often as the Version 3 editor, but it still gets plenty of love - and it's as powerful as ever!

### Products Based on the Mockups Version 3 Editor

1. [Mockups 3 for Google Drive](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/user-guide/)
2. [Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/user-guide-cloud/)
3. [Mockups 3 for Confluence Cloud](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/user-guide-cloud/)

Because they are on the Mockups Version 3 Editor, these applications will be updated day and date with our Desktop application, and have all the newest bells and whistles we have developed.

### Products Based on the Mockups Version 2 Editor

1. [myBalsamiq](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/)
2. [Mockups for JIRA Server](https://docs.balsamiq.com/jira/user-guide/)
3. [Mockups for Confluence Server](https://docs.balsamiq.com/confluence/user-guide/)

These three applications will work almost identically, save for one major difference: The Atlassian Plugins based on the Mockups Version 2 Editor (Confluence Server and JIRA Server) do not support the creation of [symbols](https://docs.balsamiq.com/mybalsamiq/symbols/). This is due to a limitation in the way the plugins were initially implemented.

## Why Choose Mockups 3 for Google Drive?

Mockups 3 for Google Drive was our first product to offer Real Time Collaboration on the same mockup, and is a fantastic tool for designers who want to work on their project anywhere.

Mockups 3 for Google Drive stores all of it's projects and information on your Google Drive account - so all you need a computer with a Flash-Equipped browser, and you're good to go!

In addition, if any of your collaborators are Mockups 3 for Google Drive subscribers, [you will be able to work with them, in real time, on the same mockup](https://docs.balsamiq.com/google-drive/user-guide/#collaborating-with-other-users-in-real-time). This is something we debuted with Mockups 3 for Google Drive, and are bringing to all our applications in the future!

## Why Choose One of the Atlassian Plugins?

The Atlassian plugins are fantastic because they build on to something your company already uses every day. Mockups for Confluence and JIRA don't require your employees or users to log into a separate software suite to use, they are built into your Confluence and JIRA instances. You can easily attach mockups to Confluence Pages and JIRA Issues without leaving your wiki or issue tracker - a completely integrated wireframing solution.
