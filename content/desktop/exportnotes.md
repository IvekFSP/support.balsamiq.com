When you [export your mockups to PDF](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/111730#exportpdf) you can choose to export the notes that you've written in the [notes panel](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1844131#notes) by checking the box labeled "Include mockup notes."

Exported images do not include mockup notes.

Another way to share mockup notes is to [share the project file](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/98989#sharebmpr).

If you are using **myBalsamiq** you can [invite people to join your project](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/235574#projectmembers) so that they can see the notes and comments you've made and add their own.
