Yes! But perhaps not the way you expect. Here’s a number of techniques: [Specifying Interaction with Mockups](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/107999).

Here’s why we’re not adding any more features to support interaction for the time being: [Why We Aren’t Doing Deep Interaction in Mockups](http://blogs.balsamiq.com/ux/2011/06/17/why-we-arent-doing-interaction/).

You might also be interested in [How to choose a wireframing / prototyping tool. Is Balsamiq Mockups the right tool for me?](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/1339732) or [the Mockups product page](http://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/#noproto), which touches on this subject as well.
