[Collaboration is the foundation](https://balsamiq.com/products/mockups/#collaboration) of Mockups. From working with your clients and customers, to collaborating with your designers and programmers, Mockups was built with collaboration at its core. Here are the ways you can collaborate.

* * *

## Share Mockups Project Files

Another way to share your work is to email your Mockups files (files with a .bmpr extension) to your clients directly, along with a link to download Balsamiq Mockups - [https://balsamiq.com/download](https://balsamiq.com/download) - if they don't already have it.

Tell your clients to install Balsamiq Mockups and open the file(s) you sent. They will be able to go full-screen and click around or view the mockups in the editor. During the 30 day trial period they’ll be able to make changes and save them.

When the trial expires, they won’t be able to edit but they’ll still be able to view them, click the links, and even copy the text strings if needed.

## Share an Interactive PDF Document

PDFs generated by Mockups are completely interactive. That means that they not only display your project as you have designed it, they will also respect [any links](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/linking) you have added to the project as well. This is one of the best ways to share your project with collaborators and clients who don't need to make changes.

## Share PNG Images

You can export all of your mockups to static PNG images, and send those to your clients. [More info about that feature here](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/exporting/#exporting-to-an-image).

## Real-Time Collaboration

Real-time collaboration is available *now* in two of our apps: [Mockups 3 for Google Drive](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/balsamiq-mockups-projects/iedapplgopkgngalkbailjoikghljkki) and [Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.jira/cloud/overview). You can watch a video example of this [here](https://support.balsamiq.com/plugins/introtogoogledrive/).

We plan to bring real-time collaboration to all of our products, and will hopefully have more to share soon!
