Collaboration is the foundation of Mockups. From working with your clients and customers, to collaborating with your designers and programmers, Mockups was built with collaboration at its core. Here are the ways you can collaborate.

## Sharing Files Generated By Mockups

### Share PDF Document

To create an interactive PDF that you can email, put online, or even show on a mobile device, first use our [linking feature](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/linking/) to link your mockups together. Then export your project as a PDF using the menu "Project > Export > Project to PDF...". A single PDF file will be created, with a mockup for each page. Clicking the links you've created should jump the PDF from one mockup to another.

### Share Mockups Project Files

Another way to share your work is to email your Mockups files (files with a .bmpr extension) to your clients directly, along with a link to download Balsamiq Mockups - [https://balsamiq.com/download](https://balsamiq.com/download) - if they don't already have it.

Tell your clients to install Balsamiq Mockups and open the file(s) you sent. They will be able to go full-screen and click around or view the mockups in the editor. During the 30 day trial period they’ll be able to make changes and save them.

When the trial expires, they won’t be able to edit but they’ll still be able to view them, click the links, and even copy the text strings if needed.

### Share PNG Images

You can export all of your mockups to PNG images that you can send to your clients. [More info about that feature here](https://docs.balsamiq.com/desktop/exporting/#exporting-to-an-image).

## Real-Time Collaboration

We have support for real-time collaboration in two of our applications: [Mockups 3 for Google Drive](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/balsamiq-mockups-projects/iedapplgopkgngalkbailjoikghljkki) and [Mockups 3 for JIRA Cloud](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.balsamiq.mockups.jira/cloud/overview). You can watch a video example of this [here](https://support.balsamiq.com/plugins/introtogoogledrive/).

We plan to bring real-time collaboration to all of our products, and will hopefully have more to share soon!
