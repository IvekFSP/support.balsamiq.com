At Balsamiq we are big fans of open source software. We use a lot of it to power our business and our infrastructure, and we try to give back to the open source community whenever we can:

*   We give [free myBalsamiq sites for open source projects](http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/105924#oss).
*   We open source parts of our code and tools, usually with MIT licensing. Visit [http://github.com/balsamiq](http://github.com/balsamiq) to find out more.

* * *
